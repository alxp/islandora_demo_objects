A Christmas inspiration.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.472
Well, I really think Santa Claus

said Jean Lawrence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:38.200
Pulling the pins out of her heavy

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.730
So do I, said Nelly Preston,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.524
as well as she could with

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:46.720
a mouthful of chocolates.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.886
Those blessed home folks of mine

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:00:51.108 --> 00:00:53.214

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.596
It was the desk of Christmas Eve and

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:57.750
they were all in Jean Lawrence's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.615

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.804
#16 was a boarding house and boarding

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:01.804 --> 00:01:03.666
houses are not proverbially cheerful

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:06.234

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.805
but jeans room at least was a pleasant spot,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.889
and all the girls had brought their

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:12.830

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.168
Christmas came on Sunday that year and

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.084
Jean had lighted the pink globed lamp on

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:23.219
her table and the mellow light fell over.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.145
Mary faces as the girls

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:26.685
chatted about their gifts.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.075
On the table was a big white box heaped

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:31.611
with roses that betokened a bit of

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:33.346
Christmas extravagance on somebody's part.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:34.598
Jean's brother had sent

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:34.598 --> 00:01:36.400

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.878
and all the girls were enjoying

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:38.878 --> 00:01:40.117
them in common.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.900
#16 Chestnut Terrace was

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.680
overrun with girls generally,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.759
but just now only five were left.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.200
All the others had gone home for Christmas,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.048
but these five could not go and

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:52.220
were bent on making the best of it.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.296
Bell and Olive Reynolds,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:55.230
who were sitting on the bed gene,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.560
could never keep them off of it,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.548
were high school girls.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:57.548 --> 00:01:59.319
They were said to be always laughing

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.978
and even the fact that they could

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:02.631
not go home for Christmas because

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:04.036
a young brother had measles

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:04.036 --> 00:02:06.324
did not dampen their spirits.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:07.326
Beth Hamilton,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:11.938 --> 00:02:14.150

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.889
away to visit as Forgien Lawrence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.167
She was an orphan and had no home of her own.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.834
She worked on the staff of one of

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:22.629

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.129
girls were a little in awe of her cleverness,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.722
but her nature was a chummy one and

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:30.367
her room was a favorite rendezvous.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.678
Everybody liked Frank Openhanded

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:32.678 --> 00:02:34.409
and hearted Jean.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.957
He was so funny to see the

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:37.628

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.382
Said all if he just bulged with parcels

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:43.398
they were sticking out in every direction.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.754
We all got our share of them, said Jean.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:45.754 --> 00:02:47.639
With a sigh of contentment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.300
Even the cut got six,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.172
I counted.

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:50.172 --> 00:02:52.788
Miss Ellen didn't get a thing,

NOTE Confidence: 0.693697443333334

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.466
not even letters said Beth quickly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.479
Beth had a trick of seeing things

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.180
that the other girls didn't.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.301
I forgot Miss Allen. No, I don't believe

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:02.301 --> 00:03:03.936
she did answer gene thoughtfully

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:03.936 --> 00:03:06.258
as she twisted up her pretty hair.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.798
How dismal it must be to be so forlorn.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.227
As that on Christmas Eve of all times hook,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:12.227 --> 00:03:15.329
I'm so glad I have friends.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.282
I saw Miss Allen watching us as we

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:17.282 --> 00:03:18.908
opened our parcels and letters.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:19.837
Beth went on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:19.837 --> 00:03:22.872
I happened to look up once in such an

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:22.872 --> 00:03:25.248
expressionist was on her face girls,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.830
it was pathetic and sad and

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.550
envious all at once.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.542
It really made me feel bad for five

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:34.888
minutes she concluded on aslee.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.074
Hasn't Miss Allen any friends at all?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.022
Ask Beth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:38.022 --> 00:03:41.790
No, I don't think she has answered Jean.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.107
She has lived here for 14 years,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.756
so Mrs Pickel says think of that

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:46.756 --> 00:03:49.579

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.626
Is it any wonder that she's

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:51.626 --> 00:03:53.910
thin and dried up and snappy?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.674
Nobody ever comes to see her and

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:55.674 --> 00:03:57.684
she never goes anywhere, said Beth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:57.684 --> 00:03:58.398
Dear me,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:03:58.398 --> 00:04:01.084
she must feel lonely now when everyone

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:01.084 --> 00:04:04.339

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.050
I can't forget her face tonight.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.986
It actually haunts me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:07.986 --> 00:04:08.470
Girls,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:14.376
thought about you at Christmas?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.670
Ow said Olive,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.480
as if the mere idea made her shiver.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.496
A little silence followed to tell the truth.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.498
None of them liked Miss Allen.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.372
They knew that she did not like them either,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.618
but considered them frivolous and pert

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:30.999
and complained when they meet a racket.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.394
The skeleton at the feast, Jean Coulter,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:35.753
and certainly the presence of the pale,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.237
silent,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:36.237 --> 00:04:39.099
discontented looking woman at #16 table,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.187
did not tend to heighten its festivity.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.585
Presently,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:42.585 --> 00:04:44.955
Gene said with a dramatic flourish.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.170
Girls, I have an inspiration,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.670
a Christmas inspiration.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.170
What is it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.166
Cried four voices just this let us

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:56.430
give Miss Allen at Christmas surprise,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.512
she's not received a single present

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:04:58.512 --> 00:05:00.839
and I'm sure she feels lonely.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.526
Just think how we would feel

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:02.526 --> 00:05:04.390
if we were in her place.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.228
That is true, said Olive thoughtfully.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.134
Do you know, girls?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:08.134 --> 00:05:10.137
This evening I went to a room with

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:10.137 --> 00:05:11.607
a message from Miss Pickerell,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.137
and I do believe she'd been crying.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.960
Her room looked dreadfully barren.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.390
Cheerless, too. I think she's very poor.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.010
What are we to do, gene?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.208
Let us each give her something nice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.932
We can put the things just outside

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:25.932 --> 00:05:27.828
of her door so that she'll see

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.198
them whenever she opens it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.264
I'll give her some of Fred's roses too,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.210
and I'll write a Christmas.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.701
He letter in my very best style

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.650
to go with them,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.858
said gene warming up to her

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:36.858 --> 00:05:38.330
ideas as she talked.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.535
The other girls caught her spirit and

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:42.770
entered into the plan with enthusiasm.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.950
Splendid cried, Beth gene.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.585
It's an inspiration.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.366
Sure enough,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:49.306
haven't we been horribly selfish?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:50.984
Thinking of nothing but our own

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:52.670
gifts and fun and pleasure?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.074
I really feel ashamed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876534259166667

00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:56.180
Let us do up the thing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.224
The very best way we can, said Nelly,

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:00.036
for getting even her beloved chocolates.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.175
In her eagerness, the shops are open.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.449
Yet let us go Uptown and invest.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.760
5 minutes later, 5 Captain jacketed

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.103
figures were scurrying up the street

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.323
in the frosty starlet December dusk.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.226
Miss Allen and her cold little

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:06:14.226 --> 00:06:16.420
room heard their gay voices inside.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.060
She was crying by herself in the dark.

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.307
It was Christmas for everybody but her,

NOTE Confidence: 0.831911676666667

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.540
she thought drearily

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.538
in an hour.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:25.538 --> 00:06:27.820
The girls came back with their purchases.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.654
Now let's hold a Council of war,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.689
said Gene jubilantly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:32.747
I hadn't the faintest idea what

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:34.158
Miss Allen would like,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.550
so I just guessed wildly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.152
I got her a lace handkerchief

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:38.152 --> 00:06:40.584
and a big bottle of perfume and a

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:40.584 --> 00:06:42.209
painted photograph frame and I'll

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:42.209 --> 00:06:44.167
stick my own photo in it for fun.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.088
That was all I really could afford.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.218
Christmas purchases have left

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:48.218 --> 00:06:50.346
my purse dreadfully lean.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.790
I got her a glove box and a

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:54.832
pin trace said Bell and all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:54.832 --> 00:06:57.240
I've got her a calendar and whittier's poems,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:57.754
and besides,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:57.754 --> 00:06:59.296
we're going to give her half

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:06:59.296 --> 00:07:00.965
of that big plummy fruit cake

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:00.965 --> 00:07:02.335
mother sent us from home.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.975
I'm sure she hasn't tasted

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:03.975 --> 00:07:05.610
anything so delicious for years.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.639
For fruit cakes,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.040
don't grow on chestnut terrace and she

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:09.104 --> 00:07:11.344
never goes anywhere else for a meal.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.352
Beth had bought a pretty cup and

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:13.352 --> 00:07:15.515
saucer and said she meant to give

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:15.515 --> 00:07:17.375
one of her pretty watercolors too.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.140
Nelly, true to her reputation,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.946
had invested in a big box

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:20.946 --> 00:07:21.849
of chocolate creams,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.040
a gorgeously striped candy cane,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.280
a bag of oranges,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.549
and a brilliant lamp shade of rose

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:27.549 --> 00:07:29.915
colored crepe paper to top off with,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.800
it makes such a lot of show for the money,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.440
she explained. I am bankrupt like Gene.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.256
Wow, we've got a lot of pretty things,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.920
said Gene in a tone of satisfaction.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.754
Now we must do them up nicely.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.236
Will you wrapped them in tissue, paper,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:43.236 --> 00:07:45.378
girls and tie them with baby ribbon?

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.500
Here's a box of it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.690
While I write that letter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.804
While the others chatted over their parcels,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.258
Jean wrote her letter and Jean

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:53.258 --> 00:07:54.890
could write delightful letters.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:56.927
She had a decided talent in that

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:56.927 --> 00:07:58.240
respect and her correspondence

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.496
all declared her letters to be

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:02.658
things of beauty and joy forever.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.646
She put her best into Miss

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:04.646 --> 00:08:05.639
Allen's Christmas letter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.210
Since then,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.205
she's written many bright and clever things,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.170
but I do not believe she's ever in

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.340
her life wrote anything more genuinely

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.770
original and delightful than that letter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:15.124
Besides,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:15.124 --> 00:08:17.956
it breathed the very spirit of Christmas and

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:17.956 --> 00:08:20.865
all the girls declared that it was splendid.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.148
You must all sign it now,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.602
said Gene,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:23.958
and I'll put it in one

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.230
of those big envelopes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.762
And Nelly,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:25.762 --> 00:08:28.346
won't you write her name on it in fancy

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:28.346 --> 00:08:30.510
letters which Nelly preceded to do,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:31.962
and furthermore embellished the

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:31.962 --> 00:08:34.530
envelope by a border of chubby cherubs

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.486
dancing hand in hand around it,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.905
and a sketch of #16 chestnut terrace

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:38.905 --> 00:08:41.326
in the corner in lieu of a stamp.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.602
Not content with this,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:42.602 --> 00:08:44.890
she haunted out a huge sheet of

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.074
drawing paper and drew upon it and

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:47.074 --> 00:08:49.012
original pen and ink design after

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:49.012 --> 00:08:51.126
her own heart, a dude ish cat.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:51.126 --> 00:08:53.949
Miss Allen was fond of the number 16 cat.

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.182
If she could be said to be fond

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:56.182 --> 00:08:57.724
of anything was portrayed seated

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:08:57.724 --> 00:09:00.020
on a rock are arrayed in smoking

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:09:00.084 --> 00:09:02.184
jacket and cap with a cigar waved,

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.690
airily aloft in one paw while

NOTE Confidence: 0.909261782

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.690
the other held out

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:06.310
of placard bearing the legend.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.122
Merry Christmas.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:07.122 --> 00:09:09.964
A second cat in full street costume

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:09.964 --> 00:09:13.042
bound politely hat in paw and waved a

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:13.042 --> 00:09:15.279
banner inscribed with Happy New Year.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.723
While faintly suggested,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:16.723 --> 00:09:19.128
kittens gambled around the border,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:21.258
the girls laughed until they cried over

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:21.258 --> 00:09:23.700
it and voted it to be the best thing

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:25.739
Nelly had yet done in original work.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.115
All this had taken time

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:27.115 --> 00:09:29.090
and it was past 11 o'clock.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:30.670
Miss Allen had cried herself

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.934
to sleep long ago,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.475
and everybody else in Chestnut

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:33.475 --> 00:09:34.703
Terrace was a bed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.200
When five figures cautiously crept down,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.936
the hall, headed by Gene with a dim

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:39.936 --> 00:09:41.790
lamp outside of Miss Allen's door,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.499
the procession halted and the girl silently

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:44.499 --> 00:09:46.509
arranged their gifts on the floor.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.610
That's done Whisper gene in a tone

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.032
of satisfaction as they tipped

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:50.032 --> 00:09:52.223
back and now let us go to bed or

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:52.223 --> 00:09:53.608
Miss Pickerell bless her heart

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:53.608 --> 00:09:56.072
will be down on us for burning so

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:56.072 --> 00:09:58.626
much midnight oil oil has gone up,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:58.626 --> 00:09:59.778
you know girls.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.796
It was in the early morning that

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:01.796 --> 00:10:03.239
Miss Allen opened her door,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.955
but early as it was another door

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:04.955 --> 00:10:06.499
down the hall was half open,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.344
two and five rosy faces were

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:09.344 --> 00:10:10.766
peering cautiously out.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.522
The girls had been up for an hour

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:12.522 --> 00:10:14.301
for fear they would miss the site

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:14.301 --> 00:10:15.900
and were all in Nellie's room,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.180
which commanded a view of Miss Allen's door.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.760
That lady's face was a study,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.950
amazement, incredulity,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.925
wonder chased each other over.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.450
It succeeded by a glow of pleasure

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:29.401
on the floor.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:32.035
Before her was a snug little pyramid of

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:32.035 --> 00:10:34.725
parcels topped by jeans letter on a chair.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:34.725 --> 00:10:36.930
Behind it was a bowl of delicious

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.450
hothouse roses and nellies placard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.214
Miss Allen looked down the hall

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:41.214 --> 00:10:43.018
but saw nothing for Gene and

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:44.704
slammed the door just in time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:45.554
Half an hour later,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:45.554 --> 00:10:47.310
when they were going down to breakfast,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.816
Miss Allen came along down the hall

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:51.748
with outstretched hands to meet them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.250
She had been crying again,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.894
but I think her tears were

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:54.894 --> 00:10:56.790
happy ones and she was smiling.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:58.670
Now a cluster of jeans.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.968
Roses were pinned on her breast.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.280
Oh girls girl, she said,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.930
with a tremble in her voice

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:06.770
I can never thank you enough.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.434
It was so kind and sweet of you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.473
You don't know how much good you've done me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.625
Breakfast was an unusually cheerful

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:14.625 --> 00:11:16.770
affair at #16 that morning.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.576
There was no skeleton at the feast,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.196
and everybody was beaming.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:20.196 --> 00:11:22.216
Miss Allen laughed and talked

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:23.679
like a girl herself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.440
Oh, how surprised I was.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.482
She said the roses were a bit like summer,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.350
and those cats of Nellie's

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.210
were so funny and delightful.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.328
And your letter to Jean I

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:34.328 --> 00:11:36.040
cried and laughed over it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.866
I shall read it every day for a year.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:39.744
After breakfast,

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:39.744 --> 00:11:41.929
everyone went to Christmas service.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.785
The girls went Uptown to the church.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:44.404
They attended.

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:44.404 --> 00:11:46.246
The city was very beautiful in

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:46.246 --> 00:11:47.724
the morning sunshine there had

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:47.724 --> 00:11:49.607
been a white frost in the night

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.509
and the tree lined avenues and

NOTE Confidence: 0.75204255

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:52.737
public squares seemed like

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.424
glimpses of fairy land.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:11:54.424 --> 00:11:57.314
How lovely the world is, said Jean.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:11:57.314 --> 00:11:59.666
It really is the very happiest

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:11:59.666 --> 00:12:01.590
Christmas morning I've ever known,

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.750
declared Nellie.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.174
I never felt so really Christmassy

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:06.174 --> 00:12:08.420
in my inmost soul before.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.252
I suppose said Beth thoughtfully that

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:11.252 --> 00:12:13.124
it is because we've discovered for

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:13.124 --> 00:12:14.992
ourselves the old truth that it's

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:14.992 --> 00:12:17.022
more blessed to give than to receive.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:18.640
I've always known it in a way,

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.700
but I never realized it before.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.180
Blessing on genes Christmas inspiration,

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.385
said Nelly, but girls let us try to make

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:26.385 --> 00:12:28.640
it in all the year round inspiration.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.791
I say we can bring a little bit of

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:30.791 --> 00:12:32.646
our own sunshine into Miss Allen's

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:32.646 --> 00:12:35.139
life as long as we live with her.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.900
Amen to that, said Jean Hartley.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.960
Oh listen girls, the Christmas chimes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.785740931111111

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.496
