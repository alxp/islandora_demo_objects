“I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, and through you to the
members of this House and to the citizens of our Province, that
we cannot be content to remain just as we are. Our position
is not good enough now, and is not good enough for our children!
I firmly believe that our Province is now at the point in its
history where the Province must decide to break the chains of
the past, and make a bold, imaginative and courageous thrust
into the future.”

The future of the University of Prince Ed d Isl i
shadowed in doubts, rumors and fears. ward Tsland is

.T}}e possibility that UPEI will be phased out over the
next five or ten years is recognized by many officials in the
post-secondary education game. In five years Holland College
is expected to be larger than the university ; possibly UPEI
will have become a liberal arts wing of the college. This year
the per capita subsidy given to Holland College students is
more than double that given UPEI students — $3, 750 to 1,731.

We are pleased that the college should prosper, but not at the
expense of the university.

If we can’t afford a good university on Prince Edward
Island, let’s not have one at all.

We don’t feel that most people on P.E.I. can afford the
extra costs that are scheduled to be imposed next year.

And are we getting our money’s worth now? The facili-
ties offered by way of residence accommodation (including
food), vary considerably. Some students get better food than
others. Some get better rooms than others. A figure of $625
has been quoted as the amount that each student in residence
is subsidized. Obviously a person living in Bernadine or Monty
is subsidized more than a person living in Dalton or Main.
But everyone pays the same.

Some departments like Sociology and Psychology are in
dire need of more, and in some cases better qualified staff.

And next year it appears that you will be paying more
and getting less. We have heard that no capital expenditures
are planned, that departmental budgets are being cut, that
the student to faculty ratio is going to rise and that students
will have to pay for varsity athletics.

Some comparisons with other universities: Memorial Uni-
versity in Nfld. has a tuition of $500 and a residence fee of
$700; University of Victoria has tuition of $429 and a resi-
dence fee of $682; University of Winnipeg has a tuition of
$425 and a residence fee of $611. Although there are more
expensive universities than UPEI students there get more for
their money and are more able to pay higher fees because of
government aid. Our cost imbalance must be rectified.

Here is the resolution passed by the students Monday
night ; “Moved that the university of P.E.I. student body wait
until Premier Campbell and the university administration give
the facts relevant to the fee increases. After receiving these
facts, the students wil analyze them and decide upon subse-

quent action if any. We also affirm our belief that education
is a right and not a privilege.”

Students must be prepared to insist on concrete and rea-
listic answers to these questions. We have had enough of
wishy-washiness and evasions.
