Donald " led the Panthers in
scoring with two goals and
two assists. Other Panther
goals were scored by Bill Car-
son, Bill Adams, Allan Flood
and Jack MacEachern.

Paul Jelley played an ,out-
standing game in the nets.

Jelley broke up several Moun- .
tie breakaways, as he poke- -
checked the puck away from

the onrushing offense.

The defensive squads of
Carson and Ballem, Chand-
ler and MacDougall played
steadily and must be credited
in stopping many of Mount
Allison: shots.

With this victory the Pan-
thers upped their season re-
cord to 3-2; following last
week’s two heart-breaking
defeats at Dal. and Acadia.

POVERTY — Alex Burke’ v
“W|II expose soui‘ces
of poverty’

by dave macleod
‘;We intend to uncover and
pubhclze the sources which
cause and promaote poverty,”

said Charlottetown - Poverty
Committee leader Alex Burke

while addressing a Progres-.
sive Conservative rally last

Saturday.

Mr. Burke made it clear
that he was speaking in a
non-political role, but indi-
cated his committee would
accept help from any quarter.

He said that many roads

had been paved in this prov-
inceand that now was the
time : to start work on the

road to recovery of P.E.L’s

underpr:ivilegedl citibens.

Burke said that alread y
the poor were outlining their

probdenls at Committee meet-
_ings, and that he intended to
- solve them.

-“T know what

they are going through iy
- said Burke.

His committee plans to
deal with the rent situation,
- housing, juvenile delinquency
and other problems, and gave
graphic example of what his
committee has a.lready un-
covered. :

“Who is better qua.llfled to
change our environment but
_the poor,” said Burke, and
further stated that mutual
respect between the poor and

. other groups would lead to in-

creased support for the com-
mittee’s cause. .

He was introduced at the
meeting by Young Progres-
 sive Conservative Provincial
President Vimy Gregory who
stated that the Conservative
Party should make sure that
more people are involved in
fighting poverty. “The voice
~ of those who should be heard
must be heard,” said Gregory
