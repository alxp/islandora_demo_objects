This newspaper research database has as its focus nine broad categories of commodities based upon Statistics Canada’s “Trade of Canada Commodity Classification”. In the 1980s work on the database was supported by the Canadian Museum of Civilization. The project received SSHRC funding in 1986-1987 as part of its Research Tools Program. In June 2013, the Canadian Heritage Information Network was no longer able to host the database due to accessibility issues.

Developers,\nlibrarians and faculty from both institutions have collaborated on an intermedia online platform designed to support the\nscholarly investigation of early modern English song. The first iteration of the platform, launched at the Early modern\nSongscapes Conference, held February 8­9, 2019 at the University of Toronto’s Centre for Reformation and Renaissance\nStudies, serves Fedora­held Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) documents through a JavaScript\nviewer capable of being embedded within the Islandora digital asset management framework. The viewer presents versions of\na song’s musical notation and textual underlay followed by the entire song text.\nThis article reviews the status of this technology, and the process of developing an XML framework for TEI and MEI editions\nthat would serve the requirements of all stakeholder technologies. Beyond the applicability of this technology in other digital\nscholarship contexts, the approach may serve others seeking methods for integrating technologies into Islandora or working\nacross institutional development environments.\nby Raffaele Viglianti, Marcus Emmanuel Barnes, Natkeeran Ledchumykanthan, Kirsta Stapelfeldt\n\nIntroduction\nEarly Modern Songscapes (EMS) is an interdisciplinary web project co­developed by the University of Toronto Scarborough’s\nDigital Scholarship Unit (DSU), the University of Maryland (including the Maryland Institute for technology in the Humanities), and\nthe University of South Carolina. EMS, “aims to develop an intermedia online platform to support scholarly investigations early\nmodern English song,” by “tracing individual lyrics and musical settings that moved through different textual and performance\ncontexts in sixteenth­ and seventeenth­century England.” Ultimately, the group has goals to build a community and resource for\nresearchers and performers interested in sixteenth and seventeenth century English song. The researchers driving the project are\nKatie Larson, from the UTSC English Department, Scott Trudell from the University of Maryland and Sarah Williams from the\nUniversity of South Carolina. The first iteration of the project focused on Henry Lawes’s 1653 Ayres and Dialogues, highlighting\nversions of the songs that have been published, co­located with image and sound materials relating to each individual song. [2]\nUltimately, Henry Lawes’s work provided a reasonable starting point for study by virtue of scope, availability, and significance of his\nwork. However, the hope is that the corpus will grow (and the openness of the project to collaboration is reflected in the absence of\na strict scope for content).\nAt the UTSC Digital Scholarship Unit (DSU), developers and librarians collaborate on the creation of a shared software platforms\non which projects like EMS can be developed. Uniquely among the DSU’s past projects, EMS incorporated off­site development of\na viewer that would display TEI/MEI delivered from the library’s Islandora­based infrastructure.\n\nProject Infrastructure\nIslandora is an open­source software framework that combines Fedora’s repository architecture with the flexibility of Drupal and\nApache Solr. Islandora developers provide Drupal modules that, when installed with their dependencies, allow users to manage,\ncreate, and access Fedora repository items (digital objects comprised of files, or datastreams) in a Drupal interface. Core indexing\nhttps://journal.code4lib.org/articles/14532\n\n1/7\n\n\f5/9/2019\n\nThe Code4Lib Journal – Visualizing Fedora-managed TEI and MEI documents within Islandora\n\nfunctions are provided through Islandora­specific modules that provide custom integration with Apache Solr. The software is often\nused to support digital collections and preservation, with “utility” modules providing enrichment functions such as annotation.\nAs Fedora repository software stores any form of XML inside repository objects, this software has been used in several TEI\nprojects and other applications have been built to integrate the TEI into Islandora (Stapelfeldt & Moses, 2013). The wysiwyg TEI\neditor “CWRC writer” [3]< has been integrated into Islandora through the The Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory [4] and\nprojects like the “Islandora Critical Edition Solution Pack” [5] through the Editing Modernism in Canada Project [6] incorporate TEI\nfeatures.\nThe Early Modern Songscapes (EMS) project made substantial use of existing utility modules in Islandora for storage and display.\nThe Islandora XML Solution pack, which makes possible the storage of XML files, enabled the project to store TEI and MEI assets\nproduced by project researchers. [7] The project also used a module called Islandora Context [8] which itself extends the\nfunctionality of the Drupal Context [9] module. The context module is very useful in this instance as it permits for the execution of\ncode given particular user or environmental conditions. In the case of EMS, the “Context” is when an XML object is viewed in the\nrepository, and the executed code is a JavaScript­based “Edition Viewer,” authored by Raffaele Viglianti at the Maryland Institute\nfor Technology in the Humanities at the University of Maryland. Digital Scholarship Unit developer Natkeeran Ledchumykanthan\nthe provided an additional EMS integration module (DSU, 2019) [10]. The EMS Integration module includes a context for use with\nthe Islandora Context module, providing a way for the Edition Viewer Javascript bundle to be loaded only when viewing XML\nobjects.\n\nXML Data Structures & Academic Requirements of the project\nThe Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) [11] is an extensible, XML­based markup language for the representation of texts. The Music\nEncoding Initiative (MEI) [12] mirrors this work to create markup language for music, but does not have a formal relationship to\nTEI. These two XML formats both apply descriptive markup principles to text and musical text encoding, which privilege semantic\ndescriptions (i.e. what some text is) over procedural ones (i.e. how some text looks). Both TEI and MEI were required for this\nproject, as the Lawes’s book that formed the initial corpus for the EMS project is at the nexus of literature and music and pays\ncareful attention to both the literary and musical aspects of the songs. In the digital editions produced by the project, the TEI is\nused for verse and the MEI format for notated music. This approach renders both editorial intervention and annotation machine\nreadable. Making this information explicit allows for the preservation of editorial scholarship in the Fedora repository as well as the\ndevelopment of an interactive publication.\n\nCombining TEI and MEI\nDespite the lack of formal relationship between the two initiatives, schemas in TEI and MEI can be combined, and both formats\nprovide elements that make the connection meaningful; namely the <notatedMusic> element in TEI and a number of elements in\nMEI that contain textual data, such as on­staff directives <dir>, poem divisions <verse>, or the more generic <anchoredText>.\nCombining these two formats is becoming a fairly established practice, see for example the Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum [13]\n(Menegozzi 2011: 841­842), but is not without challenges as existing tools and workflows are usually focused on either TEI or MEI.\nThe hierarchical nature of these formats also requires one of the two to contain the other or, in other words, take a primary\nposition. In EMS, the data model priorities TEI, in part because TEI has a well established metadata header in which\nbibliographical information is stored and this was determined to be desirable. Moreover, the single entry point provided by the TEI\nelement <notatedMusic> elements makes it possible to embed separate MEI documents within the TEI using XInclude, [14] a\nW3C recommendation that simplifies the inclusion of XML from multiple sources. See figure 1 for a schematic representation of\nthe encoding data model for a song, with TEI including MEI data. The song shown is “When on the Altar of my Hand.” Facsimile\nfrom Early English Books Online (first published here).\n\nhttps://journal.code4lib.org/articles/14532\n\n2/7\n\n\f5/9/2019\n\nThe Code4Lib Journal – Visualizing Fedora-managed TEI and MEI documents within Islandora\n\nFigure 1. A schematic representation of the encoding data model for the song When on the Altar of my Hand, a Facsimile from\nEarly English Books Online, with TEI/MEI data.\nThe lyrics underlaid under the music notation are encoded both in the MEI as syllables under notes and again as a TEI­encoded\nverse. This duplication is intentional: subsequent verses, when present, are added after the music notation and follow editorial\npatterns of early modern printing practice, which is best encoded with TEI. More information is available about the editorial\ndecisions made by the team. [15]\nRe­encoding the first verse (typically laid under the notation) allows project editors to represent their interpretation of how it may\nappear if separately formatted. Because Early Modern songs are often studied as poetry (i.e. removed, for better or worse, from\ntheir musical context), this repetition of the first verse may become useful if the text were to be presented without the music.\n\nCollating Versions of Text & Music\nA number of songs in the collection have multiple versions coming from different sources, such as manuscripts or other\ncontemporary printed editions, which can be with or without music notation. For these cases, the EMS scholars produced a\nvariorum edition that is a presentation of the text that showcases differences across the sources without privileging one over the\nhttps://journal.code4lib.org/articles/14532\n\n3/7\n\n\f5/9/2019\n\nThe Code4Lib Journal – Visualizing Fedora-managed TEI and MEI documents within Islandora\n\nother. Both TEI and MEI are well equipped formats for modeling textual variance, but both assume that one text will be the main\nreading text (often called the ‘base text’) and only variant text will be encoded from other sources. [16] To overcome this apparent\nlimitation, the project presents separate combined TEI and MEI documents that represent a collation – a document that lists where\nthe differences between the sources of one song are to be located. In practice, this document encodes a set of pointers grouped\nby variant; each pointer refers to one or more element in the source XML documents by simple ID references.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\n<app>\n<rdgGrp>\n<rdg wit=\"#L638_1\">\n<ptr target=\"TEI-L638_1.xml#v4\"/>\n</rdg>\n<rdg wit=\"#C709\">\n<ptr target=\"TEI-C709.xml#v4\"/>\n</rdg>\n</rdgGrp>\n<rdg wit=\"#BL_53723\">\n<ptr target=\"TEI-BL_53723.xml#v4\"/>\n</rdg>\n</app>\n\nListing 1. A TEI apparatus entry with pointers to three source documents\nThe example above shows a TEI apparatus entry with pointers to three source documents identified by a witness code (e.g.\n#L638_1). Each pointer resolves to text that the editors consider being a variant of each other. Note that #L638_1 and #C709 are\ngrouped by the <rdgGrp> element, which indicates that they “agree” or carry the same text (they resolve to the word “deserted”);\n#BL_53723, on the other hand, carries a different readings of the text (it resolves to the text “forsaken”).\nWith this approach, the editors are able to encode, and preserve in Fedora, each source separately to the degree of detail that we\ndeem appropriate without worrying about tessellating multiple sources in one place. The applicability of this approach goes beyond\nEarly Modern song and has been previously applied to other texts by Viglianti (2016) and is currently being improved and\ndocumented thanks to EMS and the ongoing Frankenstein Variorum edition (Beshero­Bondar and Viglianti 2018). EMS however, is\nthe first project to extend this model to music encoding. [17]\n\nFigure 2. Diagram demonstrating how the collation document points to variants.\n\nEdition viewer\nhttps://journal.code4lib.org/articles/14532\n\n4/7\n\n\f5/9/2019\n\nThe Code4Lib Journal – Visualizing Fedora-managed TEI and MEI documents within Islandora\n\nWhile the XML is stored in the Fedora datastore, the display and interactivity are handled entirely in the front end. A JavaScript\nReact/Redux [18] application loads the collation file for a specific song and determines which other source files to request based\non the pointers contained therein. Only one source (such as a specific manuscript or print) is shown at a time, with highlights\nindicating where the sources diverge. Clicking on these highlights will resolve relevant pointers to the other sources and show the\ndifferent readings. The ‘base’ source can be switched at any time. See Figure 3 for an example of the viewer rendering the\nopening text and musical notation with an expanded musical variant.\n\nFigure 3. A screenshot of the viewer showing a rendering of the opening text and musical notation of “Theseus, O Theseus, hark!\nbut yet in vain,” with an expanded musical variant in the bass line of measure 4.\nTEI projects typically perform a lossy transformation into HTML for display, but in this case we are using CETEIcean (Cayless and\nViglianti 2018), a JavaScript library that registers TEI element as HTML custom elements, thus requiring minimal or no changes to\nthe TEI source for display in the browser. For rendering MEI we use Verovio (Pugin 2016) a library that renders MEI into SVG for\ndisplay. Both of these tools offer a solution for rendering these data directly in a user’s browser, thus reducing the need for server­\nside infrastructure for TEI and MEI publications. They also provide isomorphic (that is one­to­one) renderings of the data, which\nallows to manipulate the rendering as if it were the actual underlying data. Given that the EMS data model strongly relies on data\npointers, these isomorphic representations greatly simplify resolving the pointers: their targets will be easily found also in\nrendering­ready data.\n\nConclusions / Future directions\nThe Early Modern Songscapes (EMS) project demonstrates a mechanism for rendering multi­edition TEI and MEI XML data within\nIslandora. Future work may include overall accessibility of the project site, adding additional songbooks and related resources to\nthe repository, as well as providing a means to annotate the audio and video objects, for example, by using the Islandora Web\nAnnotation module (DSU, 2018).\n\nAbout the authors\nDr. Raffaele Viglianti is a Research Programmer at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at the University of\nMaryland.

We argue that our method achieves the same goal more\nsimply.\n[18] Respectively https://reactjs.org/ and https://redux.js.org/.\n\nSubscribe to comments: For this article | For all articles\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 United States License.\n\nhttps://journal.code4lib.org/articles/14532\n\n7/7\n\n\f    metadata/dublin_core.xml  72709d5427bc9ff505171e4b590830c2edfcd437cd2457f3c2f53c7f882f2e268ca156ee1ccdefc3a4c053ea0b27cd1f6c19b3db47549539b393c985d7edc722  d0bb9bc3fa9e27fe1155a530e183c160a2346535a739a163ab300393e7a76607a2c81e80bdfc41749622f05b5ede805f49720435f4841ff8697b2fe69dc066f3  0ba9cc771ea50ada3f659d0dbf3b018bd8c189eee394962659d95e5db3847c3f8061b6c5e4ad9631e31ba13f51c4ae5176aa2bb2d96b23bab7ebf9851fc6c84f  /islandora/object/11/index.html  "

With a territory so vast and varied\nin character as is ours, the reader will not expect to find them all in his own\nneighborhood, but he will find many of them, also others quite as beautiful\nand interesting. He may regret that some favorite flower is not included,\nbut he may be sure that his regret is shared by the author who found it difficult\nto make the final selection. No two persons would have made an identical\nchoice, still, it is believed that representative plants from all parts of the\nWest except the extreme North and the Pacific slope have been included.\nIn a general way the plants are arranged according to their time of bloom,\nbeginning with the early flowers of Spring. But owing to the extent of our\ncount) y, to local conditions of soil and exposure, and to variations in weather\nfrom year to year, it is impossible to be exact as to either order or dates.\nStill, for a work of this kind, it was felt to be the best arrangement.\nIn writing of western wild flowers one meets the difficulty that many of\nthem have as yet no generally recognized common name. Such names as\nfar as possible have been hunted out and used. In some cases they lack\ndefiniteness, as where a common generic name has come into use and is applied\nloosely to any one or to all of the several species. To accurately identify\nthe flower the botanical name is also given. As the photographs together\nwith the notes on size, color, and habitat are believed to be quite sufficient\nto enable the reader to recognize any of the plants, it has not been thought\nnecessary or desirable to give detailed technical descriptions.\nThe landscape pictures are introduced to give variety of interest and to\ndirect attention to the fascinating subject of plant societies.\nTo know the name of a flower is, of course, but a preliminary to acquain¬\ntance. It is hoped that the piesentation of certain facts in the life history\nof these plants may lead readers to more attentively observe the plants\nabout them—to notice how they adapt themselves in structure and habit\nto their environment, how they bravely meet vicissitudes of fortune, how\neagerly they take advantage of favorable opportunities, and how marvelously\nin form and service they and the insects are interrelated and mutually depend¬\nent. Reference to these subjects has been much curtailed by limitation of\nspace but this is not necessarily a disadvantage. Were an attempt made to\ngive the whole life history of each plant it would be attended by two dangers:\nfirst, its lengt h might discourage many casual readers; and second, the more\ninterested might be tempted to study the written story rather than the living\nplant. Hence, the endeavor has been to make the brief text stimulative\nand suggestive.\nMay we all find in the contemplation of 1 he manifold beauties and wonders\nof Nature fresh joy, quickened sympathy, and enlarged outlook on life.\n\nW.

Richards\nPea Family\n\nThe early flowers are especially welcome and are eagerly\nlooked for. It is an event of the year to find the first anemone,\nthe well-known “crocus” of the prairie. Following this pioneer\ncome the sweet coltsfoot, a dwarf buttercup, a tiny, leafy-stemmed\nviolet, and, showiest of all, this splendid Golden Pea. It perfumes\nand brightens many a hillside and bit of prairie, always showing\na preference for sandy soil.\n•\nWhen the stalk emerges from the ground it wears a gray coat\nof silky hairs. Its tip is bent over and sheltered by large stipules\n(those leaf-like appendages at the base of each leaf-stalk), as if\nthe plant hid its face between huge ear tabs from the sudden\nexposure to wind and sunshine. As the stem grows, the threeparted leaves push out from this protection, but for a time the\nleaflets remain folded along their mid-ribs, only gradually opening\nout and assuming the horizontal position. The flower buds are\nsoon revealed, and rapidly develop into large, bright yellow, pea¬\nshaped blossoms, followed a few weeks later by sickle-shaped pods.\nIt is interesting to observe the various and ingenious devices\nused by plants to ensure the safety of the tender young shoots\nand leaves during the great change from the snug cradle of the\nbud to the full exposure of maturity. The transition is usually\nmade without injury. Many people believe that while man¬\nmade gardens are often caught by late frosts and storms, the wild\nplants have a sure instinct that leads them to defer growth until\nthe weather is safe. But this is not wholly correct, “for only\nthose who have studied nature but very little will maintain that\nshe never errs.”* The Golden Peas growing on a sunny slope\nnear the house of the writer have been badly frozen three years\nout of six, while those near by, but on the north side of a coppice,\nhave escaped all injury. These are no wiser than their brothers\non the hillside, but the brush held the snow and frost and so de¬\nlayed their start.\n‘Maeterlinck.\n\n10\n\n\fGolden Pea; Prairie Bean\n\n\fFAIRY BELLS\nDisporum trachycarpum S. IV ats.\nLilt Family\n\nHere is no plant of the open prairie.\nThe thin, soft tissue\nof it leaves and of its creamy-white flowers could not stand\nexposure to high wind, heating rain, or strong sunshine, hence it\nis in deep woods, especially on the sheltered sides of ravines,\nthat this graceful and dainty beauty of early Spring is to be\nfound. How well it chooses its home is shown by the fact that\nthis photograph of perfect specimens was taken in the morning,\nafter a late snowstorm, followed by frost, had bedraggled oi\nblighted the hardier plants up in the open.\nAs the developing foliage of the trees shuts out more sunlight,\nthe Disporum broadens out with the ample, horizontal leaves\ncharacteristic of woodland undergrowth.\nStill later in the\nseason, each branch now widely divergent, bears one or two\nbright berries where once hung the delicate bells. These globose,\nthree-lobed fruits are about one-half inch in diameter, and in\nprocess of ripening change from green to orange and then to\ndazzling scarlet. Their skin is minutely roughened, giving it\nthe richness of velvet. Within is a small quantity of juicy pulp\nand numerous ivory-white seeds.\nThe berries, although not\nlikely to be used for human food, seen harmless enough. These\nare ripe before the leaves assume their autumn tints, so, unless\ncarried away promptly by the birds, they have first a rich green\nand later a bright yellow background.\n\n12\n\n\f\fWILD SARSAPARILLA\nAralia nudicaulis L.\nGinseng\n\nFamily\n\nThe Wild Sarsaparilla can hardly be called a beautiful flower,\nyet the plant as a whole is attractive, and, for a time in early June,\nits abundance makes it the most conspicuous feature of many a\nwoodland from Newfoundland to British Columbia.\nA long aromatic rootstock bears a very short stem, from a\nbud on which spring one leaf and one flowTer-stalk.\nDeveloping\ntogether the newly-expanded leaf overarches the newly-opened\nflowers. As will be seen by the picture, both are in threes. This\nis the usual number, although sometimes there are four main\ndivisions to the leaf, and the umbels, or clusters of flowers, may\nvary from two to seven; if more than four, the extra umbels\nspring from one or more of the primary clusters, so giving a twostoried effect.\nThe small, greenish-white flowers seem to be followed by either\na full crop of fruit or none at all. In 1919 the bloom was copious,\nbut little fruit was produced; such plants, however, as had any\nberries bore full clusters, there being no half-filled ones. The\nberries are purplish-black or finally jet-black, rather sweet when\nfirst put in the mouth, but quickly turning bitter like quinine.\nThey ripen late in the season, about the time the leaf turns a\nclear yellow.\nThe roots are supposed to have some medicinal value and there\nis a slight commercial demand for them. The official sarsaparilla,\nhowever, is from quite a different plant, the smilax of Central\nand South America.\n\n1-1\n\n\fWild Sarsaparii i a\n\n\fEARLY PURPLE VIOLET\nViola nephrophylla Greene\nViolet Family\n\nEveryone knows and admires the violet, and with our\nadmiration is combined a warmer feeling, for it is a lovable flower\nwith a personal, almost human appeal.\nOut of the two hundred or more species that have been described\nby botanists, Canada has her full share (whether with blue, purple,\nwhite, or yellow flowers), but none is finer than this one, which\ngrows abundantly in wet mea’dows and beside ponds and streams\nfrom Quebec to British Columbia. The large, long-stemmed blos¬\nsoms are a true violet in color, wonderfully deep and rich if seen\nwhen “violets bathe in the wet o’ the morn.” If, some dewy morning,\nit is your privilege to come upon a little pool, bordered with\nthese Early Purple Violets, then you have indeed chanced upon\none of the most exquisite of Nature’s floral gems. You will\nnotice the rich, suffused beauty of the violet faces. You will\nnotice the tender green of the leaves, acting, by the contrast\nof their simple freshness, as a foil to intensify the blushing beauty\nof the violets which shyly peep forth above, bejewelled with\nwonderful, translucent pearls of dew-drops. The human appeal\nis so strong that one smiles in wondering if each violet face,\npeeping into the expectant waters of the pool is simply greeting,\nor studying awaking Nature. Or have we here simply the charm¬\ning vanity of conscious beauty?\nA remarkable fact, not generally known, is that violets have\ntwo kinds of (lowers. The second kind are inconspicuous green\nor purple buds on short, often prostrate, stems. The buds\ndo not open and yet they produce capsules full of seeds. When\nthis was first noticed by botanists of the eighteenth century,\nit seemed such a wonder that they named that particular kind\nthe Miracle Violet. It has since been found that with few excep¬\ntions all violets produce these cleistogamous flowers, as they are\ncalled. Self-fertilization in the bud is of course the explanation\nof the wonder.\n\nHi\n\n\f1?\n\n\fSHOOTING STAR; AMERICAN COWSLIP\nDodecatheon pauciflorum (Durand) Greene\nPrimrose Family\n\nThe Shooting Star is one of the most interesting and beautiful\nof our wild flowers, whether we consider in detail its form and\ncolor or its general effect on the June landscape. It grows in\nwet rrieadows and the bright blossoms dancing above the grass\nare a delightful sight. Even as with Wordsworth's daffodils—\n“A poet could not but be gay,\nIn such a jocund company,”\nand those of us who are not poets can also feel our hearts fill with\npleasure and dance with the sprightly Shooting Stars. Although\none may sometimes see ten thousand at a glance, they do not\nform a solid mass of color but are so scattered as to retain the\neffect of lightness and grace.\nThe habit of the plant is shown by the picture. From the\nsmooth, light green leaves rise the scapes six to fifteen inches\nhigh, carrying in umbel-like clusters three to ten or more nodding\nflowers. With their reflexed and twisted corolla-lobes, they re¬\nsemble their relative, the cyclamen, of the greenhouse, but are\nmuch more slender and dainty. The color is a bright purple,\nalmost cerise, with the throat showing a pretty combination of\nwhite anil yellow with an encircling wavy line, narrow but sharply\ndefined, of dark purple. The stamens closely surround the slender\nstyle giving a tapering point to this quaint, winged blossom.\nA fragrance, as of hyacinths, completes the charm.\n\nis\n\n\fShooting Star; American Cowslip\n\n19\n\n\fPURPLE MILK VETCH\nAstragalus hypoglottis L.\nPea Family\n\nThis is one of the earlier and smaller of the milk vetches, of\nwhich many different kinds grow in Western Canada. Its stems\nare slender, rather weak, branched at the base, and from three to\neight inches high. The flower clusters resemble clover-heads,\nwhile the leaves are reminiscent of those of the true vetch but\nare without the tendril. The pods are short, thick, and hairy.\nThe Purple Milk Vetch is common over a wide area, growing\nin the open or on the edge of thickets, in a variety of soils. It\nlikes some moisture, and, among the grass in low meadows,\nmakes a thrifty growth like that shown, almost natural size,\nin the picture; but the deep black loam of the prairie is for some\nreason not congenial. It may be noticed, however, that, where\nthe grading of a road through such soil has in places removed\nthe top layer, exposing the hard, poor-looking subsoil, t he Purple\nMilk Vetch is often one of the plants that quickly and mysteriously\ncovers the naked earth with verdure. How do plants, strangers\nto the immediate neighborhood, so promptly take possession?\nTo attempt a full explanation would take many pages, and be\nbeyond the scope of this little book. One is reminded of a sentence\nby Oliver Wendell Homes—\n“Nay, there are certain patches of ground, which, having\nlain neglected for a time, Nature, who always has her pockets\nfull of seeds, and holes in all her pockets, has covered with hungry\nplebian growths, which fight for life with each other, until some\nof them get broad-leaved and succulent, and you have a coarse\nvegetable tapestry which Raphael would not have disdained to\nspread over the foreground of his masterpiece.”\n\n20\n\n\fPurple Milk Vetch\n\n21\n\n\fTHE FOREST INVADING A PEAT BOG\nAnt agnostic riant Societies\nHere is a typical picture of one phase of the struggle that is\nconstantly going on between different plant societies. The birch\ntrees, supported by willows and alders, have established outposts\nin the bog, and the main forces of the forest are coming up to\ncomplete the conquest. The common bog plants are still holding\ntheir ground, but their leaves are no longer a healthy green,\nand their flowers are small and scattered. Evidently they cannot\nlast many more years. Behind this victory of the forest over\nthe bog is a long story concisely told by the late Prof. Geo. P.\nAtkinson of Cornell University in the following paragraphs:\n“Many of the peat bogs were once small ponds or lakes.\nThe peat moss and other plants which find shallow water a con¬\ngenial place to grow in begin marching out from the edge of the\nwater toward the centre of the pond. The stems of the, peat\ndie below and grow above. So in this way they build up a floor\nor platform in the water. The dead peat now in the water\nbelow does not thoroughly rot, as the leaves do in the moist ground\nof the forest, because the water -shuts out the air. The partly\ndead stems of the moss pile up quite fast in making the platform,\nwhich sometimes is entirely composed of peat. Other plants\nmay grow along with the peat. Their dead bodies also help to\nbuild up this floor beneath.\n“The army of peat and other water plants continues to march\nout toward the centre of the pond, though slowly. Finally, in\nmany cases, the line around the shore meets in the centre and the\npond is filled up, the floor having been extended entirely across,\nlint, they keep on adding each year.to the floor, raising it higher\nand higher, until il is high enough and dry enough for the march¬\ning armies of the dry land grasses, shrubs, and trees. At length a\nforest comes to stand on the floor built across the pond by the\npeat moss and the other members of .its society.”—First Studies\nof 1‘Iant Life, Ginn and Company.\n\noo\n\n\f\fBAKED-APPLE BERRY; CLOUD-BERRY\nRubus Chamaemorus L.\nRose Family\n\nOne must go to a peat bog in early June to find this curious\nlittle raspberry in blossom. Springing from rootstocks creeping\nthrough the moss, the stems rise only a few inches high. They\nare neither woody nor prickly as are most raspberries, and bear\ntwo or three simple leaves instead of the usual divided ones.\nThese leaves are plaited in the bud, and in process of expansion\nthe underside, with firm, close ribbing, is first exposed. Slowly\nthe ribs or veins lengthen and spread apart, and as they do so,\nthe leaf settles to its proper position facing the sky, so that its\nmillions of cells, each a tiny starch factory, may by the energy\nof the sunshine produce a full day’s output. Strikingly handsome\nthe leaves are, rich and deep in texture and color.\nA single flower, like a little white rose, tops each stalk. There\nare two kinds, as may be seen in the picture, where the four centre\nones bear clusters of stamens, while the two tall, outside plants\nhave flowers with pistils only.\nThe staminate blossoms soon\nslu'd their yellow dust, then shrivel up and that is the end of them;\nbut the pistillate ones, if they have received the vitalizing touch\nof the pollen grains, develop into the pleasant berries which give\nthe plant one of its popular names. Many fruits in ripening\nchange from green through yellow to red at full maturity, but\nhere the order is reversed, from green to red, then to yellow.\nWhen stamens and pistils are produced by separate individuals,\nthi' plant is said to be dioecious. This habit makes sure of cross¬\nfertilization, with its advantage of seeds endowed with superior\nvigor and adaptability. On the other hand, it is not an economical\nmethod as only about half the plants can produce seeds, hence\nmost of the higher plants combine stamens and pistils in the same\nflower, but so arrange things that cross-fertilization is usually\nassured, or at least encouraged.\n\n\f\fARCTIC RASPBERRY; ARCTIC BRAMBLE\nRubus arcticus L.\nRose Family\n\nMany interesting plants not elsewhere found grow in bogs,\nfor conditions of life in company with peat moss are so unusual\nthat only plants of special structure and habits can endure or\nthrive. Among the commonest of these bog-dwellers are the\nLabrador tea, a low shrub with round clusters of white flowers\nand thick leaves, rusty woolly underneath, and the cranberry,\nwith its slender creeping stems, firm, tiny leaves and dainty,\npink flowers nodding an inch or two above the moss. Among\nthe most curious are three carnivorous plants, the sundew, the\nbutterwort (whose leaves catch and devour insects), and the\npitcher-plant whose pitfalls are baited with honey above a slippery\nincline that sends unwary visitors to certain death below. Of\nthe beautiful flowers might be mentioned the three-leaved\nSolomon’s seal, the tall white bog orchis, and the pretty little rasp¬\nberry shown natural size on the opposite page.\nLike the Baked-apple Berry, the Arctic Raspberry is herbaceous\nand unarmed, but more slender and with thinner three-foliolate\nleaves. The season of bloom is a week or ten days later, the\nflowers being pink or rose-colored and delightfully fragrant.\nAs these are usually perfect, that is, have both stamens and\npistils, they each produce a berry, bright red and of good flavor.\nThe Arctic Raspberry likes a little shade, and is at home in wet\nmossy woods as well as in open bogs.\nAlthough its name suggests the polar regions, it is sometimes\nfound far south in Canadian territory.\n\n\fAornr R aqpri.'iji?v-\n\nArcrTtr RramriF\n\n\fWATER ARUM; WILD CALLA\nCalla palustris L.\nArum Family\n\n“Fes, though you may think me perverse, if it were proposed to me to dwell\nin the neighborhood of the most beautiful garden that ever human art contrived,\nor else of a Dismal Swamp, I should certainly decide for the swamp.\"—Thoreau.\n\nIf you feel in any measure the fascination of these so-called\nwaste places, as did the philosopher of Walden, you will some day\nin your rambles come upon a colony of Water Arums. It is likely\nto be in a little pool in the bog or on the margin of the swamp.\nThe dark masses of smooth, heart-shaped leaves should serve\nas identification. If in doubt, look for long, creeping rootstocks,\nwith white fibrous roots at the joints. If not yet satisfied, break\na rootstalk and taste the juice, but very delicately, for it has an\nacrid bite. In early Summer the flowers make such experiments\nunnecessary, as you at once recognize a humble relation of the\nstately calla lily of the greenhouse.\nThe flowers proper are small, consisting of stamens and pistil\nonly, and are compactly arranged around the top of the stem\ninto a fleshy spike, called the spadix. Below this is a thick,\npointed bract, the spathe, white on the inner surface, greenish\non the outside. This snowy banner behind the inconspicuous\nspike serves to attract insects, who unconsciously aid in ferti¬\nlization as they crawl over the flowers and pass from plant to\nplant. By late Summer the spadix has developed into a large,\nknotty head of bright red berries, containing hard, smooth seeds\nsurrounded by a jelly-like pulp.\n\n\f29\nWater Arum;\n\nWild Calla\n\n\fSILVER-WEED; SILVER-FEATHER\nPotentilla Anserina L.\nRose Family\n\nThe Silver-weed has a cheerful and active disposition, readily\nadapting itself to a variety of conditions, and quickly grasping\nopportunities for advancing its fortunes. Preferring wet ground,\nyet making the most of dry, it has occupied so much territory\nthat its neat silver-green uniform is well known from Newfound¬\nland and New Jersey to Alaska and California. While its behavior\nat times is such as to class it with the weeds, it certainly is not\npernicious.\nSilver-feather is a better name because of its plume-like\nleaves, silvered beneath by long, silky hairs and usually green\non top. Sometimes, however, the upper surface has also a thin,\nsilky covering. This variation with its cause is nicely shown by\ntwo patches beside the house of the writer. One is close to the\nfoundation on the south side in poor soil, exposed to full sunlight,\nand the leaves are gray green. The other is on the west side\nin rich loam, getting no sun until after eleven o’clock, and here\nthe upper surface is bright green.\nThe yellow flowers are produced over a long season, as they\nspring from the axils of small leaves on the strawberry-like runners\nsent out in profusion. These runners are usually from one to\nthree feet long, and from them new plants start every few inches.\nA mat of vegetation is soon formed. In producing and directing\ntheir runners, the plants exhibit something very like intelligence,\nas the following instance will show. On the shore of a little lake\nin 1919 grew a vigorous Silver-weed. The dry season lowered\nthe water until a strip of sandy bottom eight feet wide was exposed.\nThe plant was crowded behind and on either side by competing\nneighbors, but in front lay this land of promise, so, with concen¬\ntrated energy, a single runner was pushed out straight towards\nit. By the twenty-fourth of August an advance of over five feet\nhad been made, and eighteen young plants established on the line\nof march were aiding the parent in its forward movement.\n\n::o\n\n\fw ' '\n\njfr*/^v <^s\n\n1\n\nVI:v '• V\n\n\fROUND-LEAVED ORCHIS\nOrchis rotundijolia Pursh\nOrchid Family\n\nAlthough not one of our rarest or showiest orchids, this one\nis pretty enough, and in most districts uncommon enough, to\nmake its discovery a happy event to the lover of flowers. Some\nyears ago, in October, I found a few dried stems with empty seed\ncases at the top and a withered leaf at the base of each, and\nrecognized an old acquaintance not met with for fifteen years.\nMy eagerness took me back too early the next June, but on a\nsecond visit, the two or three dozen plants were in full bloom.\nThis small colony has flourished and spread along the little\nwaterway, and last Summer several hundred flower-spikes were\nproduced—a sight worth going far to see, and a natural garden\nworth preserving.\nThe Round-leaved Orchis lives in rich, moist woods, often\nwhere the ground is covered with moss, from which, leaving its\nsingle leaf behind, the flowers rise in crisp, glistening purity to\na height of about six inches. They are white, delicately tinted\npink with a suggestion of mauve. The upper sepal and two\npetals form a hood, and under it stands the column, a structure\npeculiar to the orchid family, in which are combined the organs\ncorresponding to stamens and pistil in other flowers. On either\nside are wing-like sepals, while in front, the third petal spreads\nout into a purple-spotted lip or apron, ami below is a curved tube\ncontaining nectar.\nThe hood protects the column, the essential\npart of the flower, the lip is the landing stage for the winged\nguest, who finding in front of him the opening into the nectary,\nthrusts in his tongue, thus bringing his head against the adhesive\nends of the two pollen masses. When he flies away to the next\nflower he of course carries the pollen along.\nThe wonderful interrelationship in form and service that\nexists between flowers and insects, suggested in the above descrip¬\ntion, is nowhere carried to such a specialized degree as in the\norchid family.\n\n\f\fBLUE BEARD-TONGUE\nPentstemon procerus Dougl.\nFjgwokt\n\nFamily\n\nThe Penstemons hold an important place in the flora of\nWestern America. Dr. Rydberg describes ninety-seven species\nof which at least a score are found in Canada. They are perennial\nherbs found for the most part on dry plains and hillsides. Their\nstems, which branch from the base only, bear opposite leaves\nand terminal clusters of showy blue, purple, yellow, or white\nflowers. The corolla is irregular with a long tube and two spread¬\ning lips. Four stamens are anther-bearing, but the fifth is sterile\nand usually densely hairy, giving to the plant its curious but\nappropriate name of Beard-tongue.\nThis particular species—the Blue Beard-tongue—is character¬\nistic of the southern part of our territory but strays northward\nin places. The clustered stems are from four to twelve inches\nhigh and usually quite smooth as are also the leaves. The crowded\nflowers are smaller than those of most beard-tongues and are\ndark purplish-blue of such a distinctive shade that once seen,\nit thereafter serves as a means of indentifical ion.\nColor, however, is not always constant enough to be a safe\nguide. Blue and purple flowers are especially subject to variation,\nand among such plants as the bluebells, blue asters, bergamots,\nand great willow-herb, lighter shades than normal are common,\nand even albinos may occasionally be found.\nDelicate shades\nof pink and mauve are quite inconstant, and the brilliant pink,\nrose, oi’ red of the painted cup seems to change with each variation\nof soil or exposure. Yellow is much more stable, and, although\nwe have many yellow-flowered plants, each has its own particular\ntone, or its own particular way of bearing its flowers, even its\nown way of forming groups or masses. Hence, by means of the\ncolor and the disposition of the color masses, a close observer\ncan usually recognize a plant while he is still too far away to dis¬\ntinguish the form of either flower or leaf. Yet even the yellows\nwill sometimes prove misleading.\n\n34\n\n\fBlue Beard-tongue\n\n86\n\n\fBIRD’S-EYE OR MEALY PRIMROSE\nPrimula farinosa L.\nPrimrose Family\n\nThe primrose, like the violet, has ever been a favorite with\nthe poets. Shakespeare, Burns, Wordsworth, and many others\nhave sung its praises. One who has rambled in the woods and\nalong the lanes and hedgerows of England in early Spring can\nunderstand what a large place the primrose holds in the life\nand literature of the people.\nBut the Bird’s-eye Primrose, although widely distributed\nand often abundant, will never take the place in Canada that\nits yellow namesake holds in the Old Land. It is too shy, and so\nunassertive in color and habit that it is often walked over without\nbeing seen. It grows in wet meadows and is usually half hidden\namong the grass. Of this Primrose, as of the walking-fern,\nit may be said that no one ever found it, unless it wTas first in his\nheart. Still, observation can be assisted to locate it. For\ninstance, the Shooting Star and this Primrose frequently grow\ntogether, so that the gaudy flowers of the former may readily\nhelp one to find its pretty but retiring relative.*\nAh! here are a few, on tip-toe, as it were, to peep over the\nsurrounding damp sedge. Pluck one and notice the corolla,\npale lilac in color, with a yellow eye. And the leaves! Notice\nhow they are tufted at the roots, of a pale green color on the upper\nside, and covered on the under sidejwith a fine white down which\ngives a white mealy effect. This white down also creeps up to\ncover the flower-stem which is from four to fifteen inches high.\nThe whole color effect is in harmony with the surroundings,\nwhilst yet leaving the flower with a modest distinction.\n*It should be said that while their periods of bloom overlap, the Shooting\nStar opens first by a week or two.\n\n\fBird’s-eye or Mealy Primrose\n\n37\n\n\fMARSH RAGWORT\nSenecio Palustris (L.) Hook.\nThistle\n\nFamily\n\nThe March Ragwort belongs to the great family of the\nCompositae which numbers over ten thousand species in all parts\nof the earth. In Western Canada, beginning in early Spring\nwith the sweet coltsfoot, the family increases in importance as\nthe season advances until late in Summer the sunflowers, daisies,\nasters, goldenrods, and other members of the family quite dom¬\ninate the floral world.\nThe flowers differ from those of other families being borne\nmany together in a compact head surrounded by bracts. In\nthis subdivision of the family the flowers are of two kinds, the\ndisk florets, small, tubular, and crowded, in the centre; and the\nray florets, more or less strap-shaped and spreading outward to\nform a kind of aureole. On account of its great size the Russian\nsunflower is a good composite to study first.\nComing back to the March Ragwort, we notice that it is a\nstout, hairy plant. The stems are eight to forty inches high,\nthe bigger ones as thick as a broom handle. All are hollow,\nwith no cross partitions from just above the root to the flower\nbranches. The outside of the grooved stem and the veins of\nthe wavy-edged leaves are often thickly covered with white\ncobwebby hairs which, seen through a hand lens, look as if spun\nfrom clear glass. The infloresence is at first compact, but soon\nopens out in a rather ragged way. The disks are yellowish, and\nthe short broad rays are light yellow. After flowering, the heads\nturn down and remain in that position until the seed is ripe,\nwhen they straighten up again. As with many other members\nof the family, each seed is furnished with a tuft of white hair\nthat acts as a parachute to float it away on the breeze.\n\n\fMarsh Ragwort\n\n39\n\n\fZONES OF VEGETATION AROUND A POND\nMarsh Ragwort forming the first belt thirty feet wide\nSuch a pond as this is a good place to study plant societies,\nboth congenial and antagonistic. Some plants live together in\npeace, sharing space, food, and water, and in various ways being\nmutually helpful; others wrage wrar on their neighbors, the success\nof one bringing disaster to competitors. The character of the\nseason has a large share in determining with whom victory shall\nrest.\nThe year 1919, or perhaps the Fall of 1918, seemed to favor\nthe Marsh Ragwort which is usually a Winter annual. In many\nplaces it was more in evidence than usual, but nowhere have I\nseen a more complete triumph over competing vegetation than\nit won around this particular pond. In the zone suited to it,\nevery foot of space was occupied to the exclusion of all else.\nBehind the ragworts was a fairly solid belt of the great bulrush.\nBack of this were coarse grasses and sedges, among which, how¬\never, the northern green orchis, the skullcap, mint, knot weed,\nand other plants were thriving. On still higher ground the willows\ndominated, as did the poplars on the low ridge in the background.\nBy mid-August the water was gone and the mud beginning\nto dry and crack. The portion of the pond bottom that shows\nas a mud bar in the picture was densely carpeted with young\nragworts six inches high. In the deeper parts, where the water\nremained longest, and among the dead stems of the parent plants,\nseedlings were breaking ground in countless numbers, hence the\nragworts bid fair to repeat their triumph next year. We may wish\nthem good luck, for they stay in their own place, do not march\nup on to higher land to choke out the farmer’s crops, and in\nJune transform their portion of the landscape into a veritable\n“Field of the Cloth of Gold.”\n\n40\n\n\f41\n\n\fTALL LUNGWORT; BLUEBELLS\nMertensia paniculata (Ait.) G. Don\nBorage Family\n\nAlthough many members of the Borage family are rough,\nhairy herbs of weedy aspect', others are of marked beauty and\nrefinement. Among the latter might be mentioned the vanillascented heliotrope of the greenhouses, and the forget-me-not\nwhich beautifies alike lonely mountain streams and formal city\ngardens. But the finest of the family and perhaps the loveliest\nof all blue wild flowers in Canada is the Virginian cowslip (Mertensia.virginica). It, however, is found only in Southern Ontario\nand is rare even there, while this western Mertensia is widely\ndistributed and abundant, no other blue flower of early Summer\nbeing so conspicuous in many districts.\nThe picture shows the plant much reduced in size, as the\nstems grow from one to three feet high. They bear open clusters\nof drooping flowers which are pink when in bud, turning rich\nblue as they open. The dark green leaves, especially those at\nthe base of the stem, are strongly and handsomely veined.\nIn open meadows, where it sometimes grows, this Lungwort\nis rather stiff and quite hairy; in shade and along streams it becomes\nsmoother, taller, and more graceful; while among bushes on\nmountain slopes, high enough to be frequently bathed in mist,\nit may be seen in such perfection as to rival its lovely eastern\nrelative.\n\n42\n\n\f\fYELLOW LADY’S SLIPPER\nCypripedium parviflorurn Salisb.\nOrchid Family\n\nThe orchids, the aristocrats of the floral world, form a large\nfamily, with family seat, as it were, in the tropics and scions in\nalmost all parts of the earth. Some of them, especially those\nthat grow as airplants on tL bark of trees in hot, moist forests,\nproduce flowers weird and fantastic, or marvelously beautiful,\nbeyond imagination. Thousands of species have been found\nby collectors who risked, and sometimes lost, their lives in the\nsearch. Sent home to Europe or America, these dormant plants\nhave been purchased by orchid enthusiasts in whose hothouses\nunder skilful and devoted care they bloom again in wondrous\ndiversity of form and color.\nOur Canadian orchids are all land plants, and while a number\nhave small, inconspicuous flowers, interesting chiefly because\nof their structure and family relationship, a dozen or so are of\nsuch beauty and distinction that they would be noticed in any\ncompany. Of such is the Yellow Lady’s Slipper pictured here.\nThe inflated lip or slipper is deep yellow, and the other parts\nare yellowish-green, often striped or shaded with dark purple.\nThe long, narrow side petals are usually twisted or curled, enhanc¬\ning the charm of these strange flowers, which are so poised that\nin a breeze they seem animate, expectant, ready for eager flight.\nThis orchid, growing in open woods and thickets and blooming\nin June, was at one time Comparatively common in many parts\nof Canada, but advancing civilization is destructive ol native\nlife, and they are becoming rarer each year. The remaining\nones should be preserved as far as possible or this splendid plant\nis likely to be exterminated.\n\n\fYellow Lady’s Slipper\n45\n\n\fTWIN-FLOWER\nLinnaea borealis var. americana Rehder\nHoneysuckle Family\n\n“He saw beneath dim aisles, in odorous beds,\nThe slight Linnaea hang its twin-born heads,\nA nd blessed the monument of the man of flowers,\nWhich breathes his sweet fame through the northern bowers\n—Emerson.\n\nThis dainty, trailing vine with small, evergreen leaves and\nfragrant, pink flowers was a favorite of Linnaeus, the great\nSwedish botanist of the eighteenth century, in whose honor it\nis named.\nIn Canada it occurs from ocean to ocean and from the Arctic\nto the international boundary. It is likely to be found in woods\nsurrounding bogs, on the shady side of ravines, and in any cool,\nmoist forest. It is especially at home in the mountains, and\nmany readers will remember how delightfully some of the wood¬\nland trails at Banff, Lake Louise, and Jasper are bordered with\nits “odorous beds.” Spring comes first to the valleys and travels\nslowly up the mountain sitles, so if the visitor be too late for it\nat the lower altitudes he need only do a little climbing. Late\nin July on a mountain slope at Jasper Park I saw, not patches\nonly, but a vast, continuous carpet stretching away for miles.\nAs we went up through the lodgepole pines, the first plants met\nwith were in seed; a few hundred feet higher some belated flowers\nwere seen; still higher, bloom was at its best, tinting the floor\nof the rather open forest as far as one could see. The slender,\nleafy vines crept over and through the fallen needles, weaving\na ground covering of pale green over which shimmered a delicate\nrosy-tinted light caused by the millions of little pink bells, each\na minute censer filling the air with delicious and delicate perfume.\n“\n\n'Neath cloistered boughs, each florid bell that siringeth\nAnd tolls its perfume on the passing air,\nMid.es Sabbath in the fields, and ever ringeth\n.1 call to prayer.’' Horace Smith.\n\nHi\n\n\f-17\n\n\fBUNCHBERRY; DWARF CORNEL\nCornus canadensis L.\nDogwood Family\n\nThe Dogwood family is represented in Canada by many\nhandsome shrubs and trees. The most famous of the latter\ngroup are the two flowering dogwoods, one species found in\nSouthern Ontario and the other on the Pacific Coast. These\ntrees, when covered in Spring with clouds of large white blossoms\nand in Autumn with brilliant foliage and bright red berries, are\nthe most splendid ornaments of the woodlands where they occur.\nOwing to their limited range, however, these flowering dogwoods\nare known to comparatively few Canadians.\nBut the Dwarf Cornel, the pigmy of the family, is common\nin cool, damp woods from coast to coast. Its floral arrangement\nis like that of its two big relatives. The true flowers are small\nand greenish, in a compact head surrounded by four white, petal¬\nlike bracts. Each flower-head springs from the centre of a\nwhorl of broad, strongly-ribbed leaves, borne at the summit\nof a stem from three to eight inches high. The stems are pro¬\nduced freely from creeping underground rootstocks and some¬\ntimes dense patches are formed. A stretch of forest floor carpeted\nwith these handsome leaves, studded with four-pointed stars,\nis a pretty sight.\nThe flowers fade, and are succeeded by berries in the close\nbunches which give to the plant one of its common names. In\nlate Summer, therefore, the green carpet is again brightened,\nthis time with coral-red fruit clusters. A little later, the leaves\nassume the rich crimson shades characteristic of dogwood foliage\nEven against this gorgeous background the berries stand out\nclearly. When the sunlight flickers through the autumn woods\non this final stage in the Bunchberry development it lights up\na scene so warm and glowing that memory recalls it with pleasure\nin the gray days of Winter.\n\nIS\n\n\f49\nBunchberry;\n\nDwarf Cornel\n\n\fYELLOW COLUMBINE\nAquilegia flavescens S. Wats.\nCrowfoot\n\nFamily\n\n“One some limes seems to discover a familiar wild flower anew by coming\nupon it in some peculiar and striking sit uni ion. Our columbine is at all times\nand in all places one of the most exquisitely beautiful of flowers: yet one\nspring day, when I saw it growing out of a small seam on the face of a (/real\nlichen-coi'ered wall or rock, where no soil or mould teas visible, a jet of\nfoliage and color shooting out of a black line on the face of a perpendicular\nmountain wall and rising up like a ting fountain, its drops turning to flamecolored jewels that hung and danced in the air against the gray rockg sur¬\nface,—its beauty became something magical and audacious.\"\n—John Burroughs.\n\nMr. Burroughs, in the fine descriptive passage quoted above,\nrefers to the Wild Columbine (Aquilegia canadensis) with gay\nscarlet and yellow flowers, the common species in Eastern Canada,\nbut with its western range limited, perhaps, to Manitoba. Our\nillustration is of the Yellow Columbine, found chiefly in the\nmountains and foothills.\nThe sepals of this nodding flowin'\nare spreading and wing-like, sometimes pale yellow, but frequen¬\ntly flushed more or less with crimson. The cream-colored petals\nare concave and spurred, five horns of honey in a circle, from the\ncentre of which projects a cluster of yellow stamens. Very grace¬\nful in form and foliage, as well as dainty in coloring, is this\nYellow Columbine.\nAmong the foothills, and extending its range eastward in\nopen woods and meadows, grows the Small-flowered Columbine.\nThe neat little flowers of this species have blue sepals, white\nshort-spurred petals and short stamens which do not form a pro¬\njecting tassel as in the Yellow Columbine.\nThe spurs of these quaint aid lovely blossoms contain nectar\nthat can be reached only by long-tongued bees or by butterfies,\nwho pay for the feast by carrying pollen from flower to flower.\nSometimes, however, one may find a columbine in which some\ninsect, unable to reach the nectar in a legitimate way. has eaten\nor bored a lmh‘ in the bottom of the spur. Such back-entrance\nrobbery is not confined to the columbine. Other plants also suffer\nfrom it occasionally, but usually the designs of insect marauders\nare frustrated by a sticky flower stem, a brisly calyx, a bitter\njuice in the tissue of the corolla, or by some other device.\n\n\fYellow Columbine\n\n51\n\n\fNORTHERN BEDSTRAW\nGalium boreale L.\nMadder Family\n\nThe Northern Bedstraw is a common plant from Quebec to\nAlaska anti southward across the international boundary. But\nit is most abundant and reaches its highest floral development\nin the northern part of its range, blooming over quite an extended\nperiod in June and July. Woods and thickets, gravelly roadsides,\nrailway embankments, and rocky hillsides are made beautiful\nby its light clouds of tiny four-parted blossoms, and the passing\nair is sweetened by its fragrant breath. Wild Baby’s Breath\nwould seem to be a more appropriate name for this dainty flower.\nIn the woods the Northern Bedstraw grows thirty inches high\nwith large, open panicles of white flowers. In the open the height\nis reduced to eighteen inches or less, the stems are stouter and\nmore erect, and the flower clusters more compact. The plants\npictured on the opposite page grew in dry soil in full sunshine,\nand were fifteen inches high. It will be noticed that the stems\nare square, and the narrow leaves borne in fours.\nThe flowers\nare followed by small bristly-hairy burrs.\nSeveral other kinds of bedstraws are found in Canada. All\nhave small, often inconspicuous flowers, and all have their leaves\narranged in whorls of four to eight. The stems of the Sweetscented Bedstraw—a woodland species with leaves in sixes and\ngreenish flowers in threes—are soft and weak, and when dried\nmake a comfortable and fragrant camp bed. Other weak-stemmed\nspecies are usually furnished with stiff, deflexed hairs or bristles\non the angles of their stems and on the edges and midveins of\ntheir leaves to enable them to scramble over stronger neighbors.\nThe burrs of many species have hooked bristles which cling to\npassing animals or men, and in this way they become widely\ndistributed.\n\n\fNorthern Bedstraw\n\n53\n\n\fSENECA SNAKEROOT\nPoly gala Senega L.\nMilkwort Family\n\nThe Seneca Snakeroot is found in dry or rocky soil from New\nBrunswick to Alberta. It seems to be equally at home in open\nwoods, among thickets, or on the plains. If supplied with shade\nand sufficient moisture, it may reach a height of sixteen inches.\nOn the other hand, in full sunshine and dry soil it seems also to\nprosper, but may be only one-quarter as tall.\nThe clustered stems rise from a thick, hard, and knotty rootstock. The lower part of the stem—the part hidden in the grass—\nis purple in color, and here the leaves are reduced to scales. The\nordinary leaf is remarkably uniform in size and shape, smooth\nexcept on the edges, and with a prominent midvein. The white\nflowers, borne in a terminal spike, are irregular in form.\nTwo\nof the five sepals are white and petal like, and are called wings.\nOf the three petals, the lower and larger one—concave and crested\n—is called the keel. The flowers never open widely, and most\nof the time are closed, giving the flower-spike the appearance\nof being always in bud. The whole aspect of this little plant\nis neat and attractive, and although it is not at all showy its\ndiscovery always gives pleasure.\nThe name Polygala is from the Greek meaning “much milk.\"\nIt was applied from a belief that the eating of it by cows increased\nthe secretion of the lactic fluid. Some of the other species may\nbe partaken of by cattle, but this one does not seem to be eaten.\nThe roots, however, although no longer considered to be a remedy\nfor snakebite, have some medicinal value, and there is a limited\ncommercial demand for them.\n\n\fSkneca Snakkroot\n\n55\n\n\fRED LILY; WOOD LILY\nLilium montanum A. Nels.\nLily Family\n\nThe. Red Lily, in slightly different forms, is common in many\ndistricts from Ontario to Alberta. It grows in open woods,\namong bushes, and along roadsides in rather dry soil. Usually\neach leafy stem is crowned by a single red, or orange-red flower,\nalthough vigorous plants may produce two, three, or even five\nin a cluster.\nAdmired for its beauty, and easily found because of its large\nsize and vivid color, the Red Lily is eagerly gathered. In rural\nhomes and schools it may be seen in great bunches packed into\nvases, cans, or pails. Town and city dwellers returning from an\nevening’s run into the country or from a First of July excursion\nhave their arms, one might almost say their cars, filled with the\nbright blossoms. The country for miles around is stripped.\nThose who gaily picked them had probably a hazy idea that wild\nflowers just happen, and in some way will always happen. But\ninto the flower the plant puts its supreme effort, an effort that\nleaves the roots lax and depleted. Their energy can be restored\nonly by the work of the leaves during the Summer. These Lilies\nand many other flowers are pulled up or broken off with all their\nleaves attached, hence the roots in their weakened condition\neither die or at best require several years to regain strength\nenough to produce more flowers.\nThe beautiful wild flowers are the culmination of Nature’s\nefforts applied to plant life through millions of years. They should\nbe the heritage of mankind for all time, but the choicest are in\ndanger of disappearing in a single generation. We have learned\nto hunt song-birds with field-glass and camera instead of a gun.\nLet us learn to enjoy wild flowers where they grow. Each has\naUife story well worth reading, legible to the patient and sym¬\npathetic observer.\n\n5t)\n\n\fRed Lily; Wood Lily\n\n57\n\n\fIN A WESTERN WOODLAND\n“.Nestled at his root\nIs beauty such as blooms not in the glare\nOf the broad sun.\nThat delicate forest flower\nWith scented breath, and look so like a smile,\nSeems as it issues from the shapeless mould,\nAn emanation of the indwelling Life.”\nA Forest Hymn—Bryant.\n\nSomething there is in the perspective of a woodland glade that\nhas a tranquiiizing and restorative effect upon the mind. Analysis\nwould but destroy the charm. And yet, just as one is here\naware of a different mental attitude when “far from the madding\ncrowd’s ignoble strife,” so one must notice the special appeal\nmade by woodland flowers. Usually they are smoothei and\nbroader of leaf, more delicately colored, and generally more grace¬\nful than their kinsmen of the plains. Nor is variety of plant\nsocieties lacking. In mixed woods especially, a few steps may\ntake one readily from one type of vegetation to another, the\ndetermining factors of the change, of course, being the amount\nof sunshine finding its way through the foliage and the amount\nof moisture in the soil.\nIn the picture opposite, showing the sloping bank of a wooded\nravine, we have in the foreground a rather compact group of\nspruce trees, and beyond the sunlit aspen forest. In the dense\nconiferous shade grow mosses and lichens in abundance but\nflowering plants are few. We may find, however, an odd specimen\nof the wild sarsaparilla, of the green-flowered wintergreen, the\none-sided wintergreen, and small clusters of that curious\nsaprophytic orchid, the early coral-root a plant without lea\\os,\njust pale stems bearing small flowers mottled with dull white,\nyellow, and purple. Moving out into the lighter shade on the\nedge of the spruce grove we notice flowers of cleaner and brighten\ncolors—the pink wintergreen, the dwarf cornel, the fairy bell,\nand the twin-flower. Under an overhanging bank are lovely\nsoft beds of the oak fern, and lower down a few scattered fronds\nof the brittle fern. In the more open poplar woods grow colum¬\nbines, geraniums, Canada violets, lungworts, and nodding onions.\nGoing down near the brook, in still more open spaces, we find\nanemones, fleabanes, and jewel-weeds. In the stieam itself\nare beds of the dainty blue speedwell.\n'1 his list of plants, although by no means complete, will give\nthe reader some idea of the flowers to be found in such a wooded\nravine almost anywhere throughout that vast irregular region,\nstretching from Manitoba to the Rocky Mountains, and lying\nbetween the open prairie and the great sub-arctic forest.\n\n\f\fPINK WINTERGREEN\nPyrola asarifolia Michx.\nHeath Family\n\nOur woods in early Spring lack many a delicate forest flower\nthat some of us knew and loved in the East. We do not have\nthe frequent April showers that bring forth May flowers. After\nthe first flush, heralding its advance, the floral pageant seems\nsometimes to halt and mark time, waiting for the Summer rains.\nMeanwhile, the days lengthen, until only a few hours of darkness\nremain. Then comes the rain with its almost miraculous quicken¬\ning of vegetable life. Verdure flows over the prairies, up the\nhills, and into the woods, quickly followed by successive waves\nof gay color. In the lighter aspen shade there are more flowers\nthan beneath the heavier foliage of the hardwood forest, and our\nmidsummer woods are adorned with many bright blossoms.\nNone is more ornamental than the Pink Wintergreen which grows\nin great profusion in rich, damp woodlands and thickets throughout\nour territory.\nIn late June or early July, from the circle of thick, shining,\nevergreen leaves, rises a slender stem, five to twelve inches high,\nbearing numerous nodding flowers, each with a curved and\nprotruding style. The petals are softly shaded from pale pink\nin the centre to deep rose on the edges. When a fragrance like that\nof the cultivated lily-of-the-valley is combined with such beauty\nof form and color it perfects a plant of rare loveliness.\nThe large buds, from which the flower-stalks sprung, were\nfully formed during the previous Summer. All parts were there\n—stem, calyx, corolla, stamens, pistil -beautifully formed in\nminiature, each separate flower-bud packed away beneath its\nown scale, and the whole enclosed by a few larger red scales.\nIn this condition, with perhaps a light blanket of leaves, they\nwere exposed to zero weather before the snow came as additional\nprotection.\nThis careful preparation of parts in miniature, so beautifully\nexhibited by the Pink Wintergreen, can be traced, in varying\ndegrees, in other plants, and, generally speaking, accounts for\nthe rapid development of vegetation when the quickening breath\nof Spring begins to loosen the hold of Winter.\n\n\f\fONE-FLOWERED WINTERGREEN; SINGLE\nBEAUTY\nMoneses uniflora (L.) Gray.\nHeath Family\n\nThe name Moneses is derived from Greek words meaning\n“single delight” and is surely appropriate. Many flower lovers\nconsider this our most beautiful wild flower, and the finding of\na colony in bloom in the mossy spruce woods is the laying up of\na treasure in memory. Such a pleasure is within the reach of\nmany, for the plant is widely distributed, although not as common\nas the Pink Wintergreen.\nThese glistening, waxy blossoms\nwith crisped edges, are usually white, but are said to be occasion¬\nally rose-colored. They are shown natural size in the picture\nopposite.\nThis little plant is prudent as well as fair. Its chief purpose\nis to produce seeds, and send them forth with a good chance of\nsuccess in life. The vitality that comes from cross-fertilization\nis highly desirable, and in the early stage of bloom, tin* pendent\nposition of the flower with the relative arrangement of pistil\nand stamens gives visiting insects every chance to carry pollen\nfrom one flower to another, and also prevents self-fertilization.\nBut even self-fertilized seeds are better than none, hence in the\nlater stage, to make assurance doubly sure, the face of the flower\nis tilted upward, even when cross-fertilization has already taken\nplace, giving the style an oblique postion and bringing some\nof the anthers directly above the five-lobed stigma.\nThese\nanthers open by pores at one end, and the curve of their stalk\nof filament is now changed so that tin* pores point downward,\nand the pollen remaining in the sacks is shaken out upon the\nstigma below.\nThus fertilization is doubly provided for_\nsurely a happy instance of the attempt by the individual plant\nto carry on and extend the species.\n\nG2\n\n\fC3\n\n\fPURPLE GERANIUM OR CRANE’S-BILL\nGeranium, incisum Nutt.\nGeranium Family\n\nSeveral Geraniums with comparatively large flowers—threequarters of an inch or so in diameter—occur in W estern ( anada.\nThe Spotted Geranium, the common form in Eastern Canada\nhas apparently not found its way westward beyond Manitoba.\nHowever, it is replaced by at least two handsome species—\nRichardson’s Geranium, with its thin leaves and delicate white\nflowers, found chiefly in woods and thickets; and this 1 uiph\nGeranium, a more hairy and rugged plant, with bright purple\nflowers, found in open meadows as well as in shaded places.\nBoth grow to a height of two feet or more, and bloom from late\nJune until August.\nIn both, the leaves contribute not a little\nto the attractiveness of the plant.\nAfter the petals have fallen, the seed vessels develop in such\na way as to give these plants the name of Crane’s-bill. The\nfive carpels or seed-pods, growing in a ring, suggest, remotely,\nthe head of a bird, and the stout column, which rises from their\ncentre, suggests the beak of a crane.\nIbis column consists of\na central five-angled axis with which are combined five stout\nbristles, each one of which is produced up from, and forms a\npart of, one of the five seed-pods. As the seeds ripen, the column\ndries unevenly and in such a way that there is a great tension\nin each bristle. This tension is ever increasing until the seedpod suddenly breaks away at its base. The bristle, coiling upward\nwith great force, acts as a spring to fling the seed a considerable\ndistance from the parent plant. After the explosion the empty\ncases hang from the top of the column’s axis in a pretty chandelierlike group.\nOn a dry, warm day it is interesting to watch the operation\nof this novel process of seed distribution. If the obser\\ei be\npressed for time or lacking in patience he may hasten its action,\nfor a touch will often spring the mechanism of this vegetable\ncatapult\n\n\f\fTALL WHITE CINQUEFOIL\nPotentilla arguta Pursh\nRose Family\n\nThe Cinquefoils are ubiquitous in Western Canada.\n\nOn the\n\nrocky summits of mountains grow low, tufted forms, starred with\nshort-stemmed blossoms.\n\nIn moist and fertile meadows in the\n\ndeep valleys they flourish in variety, reaching a height of three\nfeet or more.\n\nOn the dry plains, by clothing themselves in dense\n\nhair or wool, they endure successfully scorching sun and wind.\nTn swamps and peat bogs the marsh cinquefoil with its curious\ndark red flowers is a common sight.\n\nAlong brooks and truces,\n\namong piles of rubbish, and in cultivated ground one will every¬\nwhere find cinquefoils.\n\nSome two score species are scattered\n\nover Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta.\n\nThe great majority\n\nhave yellow flowers and all have compound leaves.\n\nI he leaflets\n\nvary in number from three to thirteen, but as five is common,\nthe name, cinquefoil, has been applied to all.\nThe Tall White Cinquefoil impresses one as being a rather\nhandsome plant of gentlemanly attitude.\n\nIts strawberry-like\n\nblossoms are commonplace enough, its general aspect is not very\ndifferent from some of its weedy kinsfolk, yet it has an air of\ndistinction.\n\nTrying to analyse the cause we notice that the stems\n\nare tall, erect, and moderately slender, that the leaves are well¬\nshaped, neatly veined, and evenly covered with somewhat glandu¬\nlar hairs, that the flower clusters are compact and the blossoms\nclose-set, and that there is a certain dignified reserve about the\nwhole plant.\n\nIt does not take advantage of superior height to\n\nthrust its elbows into the faces of its neighbors, and it sends out\nno runners to seize adjoining land. Yet the Tall White Cinquefoil\ngets on very welli n the world, and may frequently be met with\n\nin dry meadows and thickets throughout the whole breadth of\nour territory.\n\n\f\fCOW PARSNIP\nHeradeum lanatum Michx.\nCarrot Family\n\nThis lusty perennial of decorative character is widely distri¬\nbuted, from Newfoundland to Alaska, and\n\nsouth from North\n\nCarolina to California, but reaching its greatest profusion in the\nNorth where one of the rivers is named “The Parsnip” because of\nthe abundance of the growth of this plant on its banks.\n\nIn the\n\nopen it grows three or four feet high, and almost as many wide,\nwhile in moist, shaded places it stretches up eight feet.\ndamp soil, as its broad leaf-surfaces indicate.\n\nIt prefers\n\nThe hollows in\n\nt hese, caused by the waved and curled edges, the shallow channels\non the stalks of the lower leaves, and the inflated sheaths on the\nupper ones, aid in catching rain and conveying it down the stem\nto t he cluster of fleshy roots.\nThe white flowers, opening in June and July, are borne in\ngreat umbels sometimes a foot across.\n\nThe outer petals of the\n\noutside flowers'are enlarged, spreading out where they find room,\nso making the whole head more conspicuous.\n\nSuch massing of\n\nmany minute flowers, in various forms, is common among plants\nand adds to their beauty and efficiency.\n\nIn the one under\n\nconsideration, the large, honey-laden expanse of white attracts\nmany insects, and the flat clusters afford a firm and ample feeding\nplatform for these guests.\n\nIn return they carry the pollen from\n\none flower to another, and from plant to plant, so bringing about\nthe cross-fertilization necessary to maintain the vigor of successive\ngenerations.\n\n\fi\n, , fiji\n\\ ■ a A 4mj\n\nif\n\nCow^Parsnip\n\n69\n\n\fPRAIRIE PINK; SKELETON WEED\nLygodesmia juncea (Pursh) D. Don\nChicory Family\n\nThis meagre plant is in striking contrast to the umbrageous\nCow Parsnip which we have just been considering. The one\nsuggests the dry plains of the South, the other, the moist valleys\nof the North; the one suggests stern struggle against conditions\nadverse to life, the other, easy enjoyment of all the good things\nin the plant world. Yet I have seen them growing within a\nfew hundred yards of each other, one on a gravelly, sunny slope,\nthe other in the springy soil at the bottom. Each is a successful\nand (if we share Wordsworth’s faith “that every flower enjoys\nthe air it breathes”) a happy plant.\nThe Prairie Pink is successful because it has adapted itself\nto hard conditions and ordered its life with frugality in all things.\nThe roots are thick, woody, and deep in the soil, hence are not\nshrivelled up by drought. The leaves are reduced to narrow,\npointed bracts in order that the scanty supply of moisture may\nnot be lost by rapid transpiration. Even the flower-heads have\nonly five florets instead of the one hundred or more found in\nmany other members of the family—the dandelion for instance.\nThe flowers, which open in bright weather and remain open but\na short time, are a pretty shade of pink.\n\n70\n\n\fPrairie Pink; Skeleton Weed\n\n71\n\n\fSCARLET GAURA; BUTTERFLY WEED\nGaura coccinea Nutt.\nEvening-Primrose Family\n\nThe Scarlet Gaura, an interesting plant of the open prairie,\nmay often be found growing in gravelly soil from Manitoba to\nthe Foothills of the Rocky Mountains.\nThe much-branched stems are usually decumbent (that\nis, reclining at the base with their tips ascending) and vary in\nheight from four inches to a foot or more. The small and numer¬\nous leaves are usually hoary by reason of thoi 1 close coating of\nshort, gray hair. The drier the soil in which the plant glows\nthe heavier is this protective covering.\nBut on the flowers our chief interest centres, for they have\nthe curious habit of expanding four pure white petals and shortly\nafterward dyeing them scarlet. Hence, one may commonly\nfind flower-spikes with white flowers above and brilliant scarlet\nones beneath. This startling color scheme is rendered more\nstriking by reason of the fact that the eight prominent stamens\nhave white filaments and large brick-red anthers. Sometimes,\nhowever, the petals remain white during the whole of a warm\nsunshiny day. This was the case with the plants whose photo¬\ngraph, reproduced on the opposite page, was taken by the roadside\nat four o’clock of a day in early July. It will be noticed that the\npetals are drooping somewhat from the ardent heat, yet no blush\nof red has yet appeared. Some of these plants were taken home\nand placed in a cool cellar overnight. Next morning the flowers\nof the previous day were mostly withered, but five or six fresh,\nwidely-expanded flowers adorned each stem. A good pliotogiaph\nof these plants with wide-awake blossoms was then made.\nSubsequently, when shown to a well-known botanist, the early\nmorning photograph quite puzzled him, while the one taken in\nthe afternoon was declared at once to lie a typical picture of\nthe Scarlet (laura.\nHere it has been thought better to present the plant in its\ndrowsy aspect.\n\n\fi\n\n(\n\nc\n\n73\n\n\fPURPLE PRAIRIE CLOVER\nPetalostemon purpureus (Vent.) Rydb.\nPea Family\n\nThe Purple Prairie Clover is a perennial with a deep, tough,\nwoody root from which grow clustered stems in height from one\nto three feet. The smaller stems are simple, the larger branched,\nand each stem or branch is terminated by a short, dense flowerspike. Before the flowers open, early in July, the spike is a soft,\npretty shade of gray, with spiral rows of closely packed buds.\nThe lowTer buds open first, and the circle of bright purple corollas\ntravels upward.\nThe color scheme of the flower is rendered\nmore striking by reason of the deep orange anthers that project\nbeyond the corolla.\nThe structure of the flower is so different from the usual pea\nblossom that young botanists often have difficulty in identifying\nit\nIn the first place, it has no keel (formed by the union of the\ntwo lower petals). It has, it is true, a banner but represented\nonly by a petal somewhat broader than the rest, the other four\nbeing alike. The five stamens are distinct from each other,\nas compared with the nine or ten more or less united stamens\nin other members of the family. Then the pod is very short\nwith only one seed.\nThe Purple Prairie Clover is found abundantly on dry plains\nand gravelly hills throughout our territory. It is a typical dry\nground plant, almost as much so as the Prairie Pink described\nand pictured on earlier pages. It has more foliage than the latter\nplant, but the leaflets are narrow and the edges are rolled inward\nto protect the under side of the leaves, where the breathing pores\nare located. Its root also is admirably adapted to withstand\ndrought.\nA white-flowered species, with somewhat broader leaflets and\nlonger flower-spikes, is common in many districts. Two additional\nones are also sometimes found—the slender white prairie clover\nand the silky prairie clover.\n\n\fPurple Prairie Clover\n\n75\n\n\fNORTHERN HEDYSARUM\nHedysarum boreale Nutt.\nPea Family\n\nThe Northern Hedysarum is a native of the northern and\nwestern part of the Continent. Common among thickets, along\nroadsides, and on the plains, it is, over wide areas, quite the most\nabundant member of its family.\nThe picture shows it greatly reduced in size, as the plants\nphotographed were more than two feet tall. The height, however,\nvaries from one to three feet. The rather stout stems bear\npinnate leaves, having from eleven to twenty-one leaflets. 1' rom\nthe axils of the upper leaves spring long racemes of numerous\npale pink, rose, or purple flowers. Although the stems are stiff,\nthe drooping blossoms and light foliage lend an air of elegance\nand grace to the plant. The drooping flowers are succeeded by\ndrooping pods. As these are prominently jointed, they serve\nas a ready means of identification.\nSeveral other species of Hedysarum occur in Western Canada.\nAs none of them seem to have yet been given a common name,\nthey must be referred to by their botanical names. //.\nsulphurescens closely resembles the one described above but has\nsulphur-yellow flowers, and is found chiefly in the mountains\nand foothills. II. cinerascens, with reddish-purple flowers and\nsilvery leaves, is found in dry soil on the prairie. It. Mackenzii,\nthe most showy one of all, is common in the meadows of the\nfoothills and eastward in the southern part of the prairie region.\nOn river banks it seems also to be spreading far to the East and\nNorth. Its manner of growth- clustered stems, eight to eighteen\ninches high, forming a rounded mass of bright green foliage\ntopped with clusters of large flowers of a vivid rose-purple—\nrenders it one of the most striking and handsome of our wild\nplants.\n\n\fNorthern Hedysarum\n/\n\nt\n\n\fA ELOWER-BORI)ERED ROAD\n“A lover of nature never lakes a walk without perceiving so met hint)\n■new and interesting.”—John Burroughs.\n\nA flower-bordered trail over the gently rolling prairie, a clump\n■or two of poplars or willows, overhead the deep blue sky and the\nsplendid everchanging cloud formations—such a scene as this\nis repeated in endless variation throughout the Prairie Provinces\nduring the Summer months.\n. A list of the roadside flowers would be too long for this page.\nThey form a lovely natural calendar, giving to the observant\npasser-by accurate information concerning the character and\nprogress of the season. Xo two years are just alike. Conditions\nof weather may hasten or retard flowering time. A wet year\nfavors the moisture-loving plants and they make a remarkable\ndisplay. A dry season discourages these and brings a different\nset into unusual prominence. One may use a road for a lifetime\nand still each year will show some new floral feature.\nJust over the ridge on this road is a little pond which three\nyears ago in June was filled with slender submerged stems\nand thread-like leaves of the White Water-Crowfoot, the surface\nbeing starred with thousands of the delicate, golden-centred\nblossoms.\nThe following year the water disappeared.\nThe\nWater-Crowfoot bravely met the new condition. It modified\nits leaves so that they could live out of water, threw out roots\nfrom creeping stems, and covered the mud with lacy foliage\nand the same pretty flowers. Last year the mud dried up, and\nonly by careful search could a few weak plants be found among\nthe coarse grasses and sedges that had taken possession. If this\ncoming season tin1 pond tills again will the Water-Crowfoot flour¬\nish as before?\nThis is but an example of the many stories of plant lilt' that\nniav be read as interesting serials while one travels familiar\nroads.\n\n7S\n\n\fA Flower-bordered Road\n\n79\n\n\fHEDGE NETTLE\nStachys palustris L.\nMint Family\n\nSo common is tlie Hedge Nettle throughout Canada that it\nis no doubt known to most of our readers. Yet to know the name\nof a plant is but a preliminary to acquaintance, so let us consider\nthis plant in some of its details of structure and habit.\nAlthough hardly a kindly way to begin we shall carefully\ndig up a thrifty Hedge Nettle and examine its roots. At once\nit \"will be noticed that the plant is a perennial with quantities\nof long underground rootstocks. If our plant happens to grow\non the edge of cultivated land these runners will have been direct¬\ned away from the congestion behind towards the space and free¬\ndom of the garden or field. The Hedge Nettle can therefore\ntravel toward opportunity.\nIn Autumn some of these underground stems become thickened\nuntil they look like slender white tubers, as indeed they are,\nfor the portion connecting them with the plant is thin and easily\nbroken, and, if these crisp tubers be taken and planted like\npotatoes, they will make a ready growth. The Hedge Nettle\ntherefore carries life insurance.\nLeaving the root, we notice that the stems are square. Now,\nsquare stems are said to have a mechanical advantage over round\nstems where leaves are borne oppositely, as in this plant. For\nit must not be thought that stems are a simple aggregation of\ncells.\nOn the contrary, they are wonderful and complicated\nstructures, each designed to carry the loads and stand the strains\nincidental to the particular type of plant and its manner and\nplace of growth.\nPlants constructed reinforced columns and\ngirders with great efficiency and economy of material, long bcioii\nhuman engineers knew of such things, and the Hedge Nettle\nis no mean exponent of Nature’s mechanics. Of course the stem\nhas other functions besides that of furnishing support. Through\nspecial lines of cells in the stem the raw sap is carried upwaids\nto the leaves, and through other cells the enriched sap is returned\ndownwards to the roots, or carried to other growing pails of tin\nplant.\nAlthough space does not permit of it here, the reader may pass\non to the consideration of the leaves, flowers, and seeds, assured\nthat each detail of form and arrangement is of vital use and\nmeaning in the life of the Hedge Nettle.\n\n80\n\n\fHedge Nettle\n\n81\n\n\fGREAT-FLOWERED GAILLARDIA\nGaillardia aristata Pursh\nThistle Family\n\nThis Gaillardia, perhaps the handsomest member of the\nSunflower tribe, is a native of the western hills and plains. W hilst\nfound over a wide area, it is most abundant in the southern part\nof our territory. It prefers sandy and gravelly soil and rejoices\nin full exposure to sunshine. Its graceful form and its wonderful\ncoloring have attracted the attention of horticulturists, so that\ntoday one may find it in the best laid out gardens everywhere.\nThe stems, one or two feet high, are gray-green by reason\nof their hairy covering, as are also the leaves. The flower-heads,\ncarried singly on long stalks, are from two to four inches in\ndiameter. At first the disk is flat and light green, but soon after\nshows an outer ring of dark red. As the florets open, the outer\nones first, this red ring spreads inward, its progress being marked\nby the projection of successive rings of yellow anthers. Finally,\nthe green buds having all opened, the whole disk becomes reddishbrown, convex in shape, and heavily fringed with brown hairs.\nThe broad, overlapping rays, notched at the ends, are sometimes\nentirely golden yellow but oftener at the base are flushed dark\nred, and veined, especially on the underside, with the same color.\nThe whole combination of size, form, color, and texture is\ncharming, and vests this Brown-eyed Susan of the plains with\na wealth of glowing beauty. When each Province comes to\nadopt an official flower, the Gaillardia should be a candidate for\nsuch honor in the West.\n\n\fGreat-flowered Gaillardia\n\n83\n\n\fTALL MEADOW RUE\nThalictrum purpurascens L.\nCrowfoot Family\n\nGrowing in open woods and thickets and along roadsides,\nthis Meadow Rue, lifting its big panicles of cream-colored tassels\nsix feet high, is one of the elegant plants of late June or early\nJuly. The large but finely divided leaves resemble coarse maiden¬\nhair ferns, and, together with the feathery bloom, give an airy\ngrace to the tall herb.\nIt is usually of dioecious habit. Neither male nor female\nflowers have petals and the sepals arc small and drop off early.\nThe male cluster owes its beauty to the masses of anthers drooping\non slender filaments, and the female cluster to the numerous\nbunches of pistils with long, glistening stigmas, which are admir¬\nably shaped to catch pollen as it drifts through the air.\nThere is here no elaborate arrangement for securing fertilization\nby insects and although they may sometimes be of service, chief\ndependence seems to be placed on the wind as carrier. Con¬\nsequently the flowers are held above surrounding vegetation,\nami pollen is produced lavishly to allow for the great waste\nresultant from this simple method.\nSometimes the pistillate plants bear also a few stamens with\nfertile anthers, showing that there is perhaps an ambition to reach\nthe higher development which would be indicated by the pro¬\nduction of perfect flowers, a point already reached by some of\nthe meadow rues.\nIn our greatly reduced photograph are shown two male plants\non the outside and a female in the centre.\n\nM\n\n\f\fLOCO-WEED\nOxytropis Lamberti Pursh\nPea Family\n\nThe Loco-weed, although well-known in Western Canada,\nis notorious rather than renowned. Its bad reputation is due\nto its poisonous effects when eaten by sheep, cattle, and horses,\ncausing them to stagger in their gait, to walk in circles, and other¬\nwise behave as no well-regulated animals should. Sometimes the\ndeath of the afflicted animals results. Yet there seems to be\nsome mystery about the plant, for over certain wide areas where\nit grows one scarcely ever hears of a case of loco-poisoning, while\nother parts of the country report such an occurrence frequently.\nThe Loco-weed exhibits great variation also in form and\ncolor, both among individuals in the same locality, and among\nthe types found in different localities. Our picture gives a general\nidea of the aspect of the plant—clustered leaves and flower-stalks\nspringing from a deep root, both leaves and stalks more or less\ngray with silky hairs, and many pea-shaped blossoms borne in\nspikes. Frequently, however, the spikes are denser and shorter\nthan those shown opposite, and, instead of light cream-colored\nflowers such as this plant produced, the bloom may be purple\nor reddish-purple.\nAlthough “beauty is what beauty does” the Loco-weed\nis a pretty plant, and it has several handsome relatives. Foremost\nof these is the Showy Oxytrope found commonly on dry prairies\nfrom Manitoba to the Rockies. It may be distinguished from\nthe Loco-weed by its more hairy leaves, which are so densely\ncovered with long silvery hairs as to appear white; by its leaflets\nwhich are borne in bunches of three to five instead of singly;\nand by its more showy rose-purple flowers which are arranged\nin more narrow and elongated spikes. Indeed, the Showy\nOxytrope (0. splendens) is well named, for with its shafts of bright\nblossoms rising from a mass of soft, shining white foliage it forms\nin June one of the most conspicuous and splendid ornaments\nof the dry prairie.\n\n\fLoco-Weed\n\n87\n\n\fNODDING WILD ONION\nAllium cernuum Roth.\nLily Family\n\nAs a culinary herb the onion is known to everyone, but many\nfail to recognize in this dainty and graceful plant a member of\nthat odorous tribe.\nAnd yet its narrow, long-necked bulbs\npossess the characteristic odor in such concentrated power as\nto render them highly objectionable to some people. Still, since\nthe bulbs are deep in the soil, they need not interfere with our\nadmiration for the pretty flowers.\nThe leaves of the Nodding Wild Onion are not hollow tubes\nlike those of the garden onion, but are flat and grass-like, and pale\ngreen in color by reason of a whitening bloom. The flowerstalks, growing one or two feet high, over-top the leaves. Each\nstalk bears many nodding flowers in an umbel. At first each\nbud cluster is enclosed in a thin, semi-transparent membrane,\nas shown in the upper left-hand corner of our picture. Soon the\nexpanding buds burst this fragile covering, and one after another\nopen like tiny bells with six projecting stamens. In texture the\nflowers are thin and delicate, and in color they vary from white\nto rose, and purple, the more delicate shades being common.\nThe sheathed buds, rising upon a slender stalk and bursting\ninto downward-pointed blossoms, suggest a rocket, which, rising\nhigh into the air, curves gracefully earthward and then, explod¬\ning, casts down a shower of gailv-colored stars.\nThe Nodding Wild Onion is a typical flower of the prairie\ncountry and in midsummer may often be found blooming on\nwooded banks among thickets, and in meadows.\n\n88\n\n\f■\n\nNodding Wild Onion\n\n89\n\n\fTALL OR GLAUCOUS ZYGADENUS; WHITE\nCAMAS\nZygadenus elegans Pursh\nLily Family\n\nThis beautiful Zygadenus may frequently be found in wet\nmeadows throughout the Western Provinces. However it may\noccur, in scattered groups or in greater profusion, it is always in\na quiet and elegant way an attractive feature of the landscape.\nSpringing from bulbous roots, the stems rise to a height of\none to three feet. Both stems and leaves are smooth and glaucous\n—whitened with a bloom. The smaller stems bear their flowers\nin a simple raceme, but the stronger ones may carry a large, open\npanicle of bloom a foot in length. Each flower, about threequarters of an inch in diameter, is white or greenish-white with a\nlarge green gland, shining with a moist secretion near the base\nof each of,its six divisions. The three-parted pistil with the\nsix surrounding stamens adds much to the beauty of the flower.\nThis White Camas, to use another of its names, is unfortunate\nin its relatives. Several related species, known as Death Camas,\nare so poisonous that numerous animals, especially sheep, die\neach year from having eaten of them. The \\\\ hite ( amas is said\nto have in some degree the same poisonous principle, but to be\nvery seldom eaten by stock. With the descriptions here given\nand the picture shown opposite as guides to identification no\none need make a mistake. The deadly species are smaller in\nsize, with narrower leaves which are rather rough to the touch.\nMoreover, the gland, so distinctive of the White Camas, is not\nmuch in evidence in the smaller and more crowded yellow or\nyellowish flowers of the Death Camas.\n\n\fTall or Glaucous Zygadenus; White Camas\n\n91\n\n\fOVAL-LEAVED MILKWEED\nAsclepias ovatifolia Dec.\nMilkweed\n\nFamily\n\nA flower of such marked individuality as the milkweed, once\nseen in life or in picture, is easily recognized thereafter. For\nalthough several species occur in Western Canada, differing in\ncolor and in many details, the unique flower-form common to\nall, sets them apart from other plants.\nThe Oval-leaved Milkweed is probably the commonest western\nspecies, growing in rich, well-drained soil, either in full sunshine\nor among bushes, from Manitoba to Alberta.\nIts stalks are\nfrom six to eighteen inches high, its leaves, especially on the\nunderside, are soft-downy, and its greenish-white flowers, some¬\ntimes tinted with purple, are borne in soft umbelled clusters.\nAnd now to a closer study of these prettily and curiously\nformed flowers. In addition to the calyx, and a corolla with live\nreflexed lobes, there is in the centre of the flower a five-lobed\nstructure happily named the crown. But when the botanist speaks\nof each lobe of the crown as a hood, and the hood as bearing a\nhorn, and the horn as having a tooth on either side, it begins to\ngrow confusing. Still, these features may bo seen fairly well in\nour picture. But to study the inner structure of the flower in de¬\ntail is impossible here. Suffice it to say that the pollen is produced\nin minute paired masses, each pair connected by a kind of clip,\nhaving a catch in the centre, and that the two pistils are em¬\nbedded in a flashy column. The problem of the plant is to bring\nthe pollen masses of one flower into contact with the stigmas of\nanother flower, and this can only be done by insect agency.\nAccordingly, the flowers secrete neetor, and then advertise it\nby a heavy sweet odor which attracts bees and butterflies in\nlarge numbers.\nAlighting upon one of the yielding flower clusters, the heavy\nbumble bee finds himself suddenly swinging head downward.\nGrasping frantically for a foothold, his legs are likely to slip\ninto the catches on the pollen clips, and as he jerks himself free\nthe pollen is torn from the flower and remains attached to his\nlegs. Later, the same kind of a scramble for foothold while sip¬\nping nectar results in some of the pollen being rubbed off upon\nth(> stigmas of other flowers.\nTo the human observer this may seem a rough way of per¬\nforming a delicate operation. It may also seem to be a highly\ncomplicated mechanism for producing the apparently small\nresults attained, for of the thirty of forty flowers in a cluster,\nusually only one or two become fruitful and develop into big,\nsoft pods of silky-tufted seeds. But although we may wonder\nat Nature’s methods, they are here amply justified in the final\nresult, for tin* milkweeds are a numerous, vigorous, widely\ndistributed, highly successful tribe of plants.\n\n\fOval-leaved Milkweed\n\n93\n\n\fROUGH FLEABANE DAISY\nErigeron glabellus Nutt.\nThistle Family\n\nFleabane daisies are extremely common in Western America.\nIn Rydberg’s Flora one hundred species are described, of which\nprobably one-third are found in Canada. A number of these,\nhowever, grow only in the mountains.\nThe Erigerons are often mistaken for Asters. Without going\ninto botanical details, it may be said that the former bloom in\nJune and July, the latter in August and September. Also, the\nErigerons have smaller and much more numerous disk florets,\nand narrower and more numerous ray florets than the Asters.\nThis may be seen in the picture opposite, where the close firm\ndisk, made up of a multitude of tiny florets, is encircled by a thick\nfringe of fine rays numbering one hundred or one hundred and\nfifty.\nThe Rough Fleabane grows in dry soil and is common on the\nprairie. Its stems are from five to fifteen inches high. They\nand the leaves are usually somewhat rough to the touch, although\nhardly rough enough to justify the common name of the species.\nThe flower-heads on each stem are few in number, but, as the\nstems are clustered, the flowers make a pretty show among the\ngrass. Their disks are yellow, and their rays blue, purple, mauve,\nor occasionally nearly white.\nAn earlier-flowering species is so abundant and showy that it\nmust have at least a few words of description. It is the Phila¬\ndelphia Fleabane, with upright stems, usually from two feet to\nthree and one-half feet high, each carrying many pink or lavender\nflowers. Unlike the Rough Fleabane, this species loves wet\nground. One may often see stretches of low land brightened\nby its myriad blossoms, or with even greater pleasure one’s eye\nmay trace the winding course of a brook through a meadow,\nby the bands of these gay flowers along its margins.\n\n94\n\n\f\fWILD BERGAMOT\nMonarda mollis L.\nMint Family\n\n’\n\nThis is a handsome member of the aromatic Mint family,\ngrowing in abundance on the prairie, along roadsides, and among\nopen thickets. The stems are one to two-and-a-half feet high,\nbear gray-green, soft-hairy leaves, and arc crowned in midsummer\nby rosy-pink or lilac flowers in dense clusters. These open from\nthe centre outward. The long, narrow, upper lip of the corolla\nstands erect, the lower and broader lip is curved downward, as\nare also the buds, both being covered with soft hairs and showing\ndelicate gradation in color from nearly white to purple. The\ncombination of form, texture, and color throughout the entire\nplant is in quiet, but elegant, taste.\nUnlike the eastern Bergamot many flowers arc open at once,\nso that the head is full and fluffy. This fulness of flower-head,\nor length of spike, is noticeable in many plants of Western Canada.\nThe phenomenon is due to the coolness of the nights, to frequent\nsummer showers, and to the moisture-holding power of the black\nprairie soil. In an unusually hot and dry season, the individual\nflowers fade more quickly and the richness of the floral display\nis diminished.\n\n\f\fA FERNY DELL\nA Congenial Plant Society\n\nTo discover such a fern-filled woodland as this would be\ndelightful anywhere, but especially is it so in the Prairie Prov¬\ninces, where, owing to the moderate rainfall and dry air, ferns\nare not as much in evidence as in the moister parts of Eastern\nCanada and British Columbia. It has been stated that ferns are\nnot found anywhere in the prairie region even where trees and\nbrush abound. Such a statement overstates a tendency, since our\npicture, taken in prairie country, is evidence that luxuriant beds\nof ferns do so occur, further, they are more numerous than is\ncommonly believed.\nThey do not of course occur on the dry, open plains. Shade\nand moisture are necessary for this Ostrich Fern, as it is called,\nwith its great fronds three to six feet high. But such favorable\nconditions are found in wet woods and thickets, especially along\nstreams, and from Newfoundland to British Columbia, one\noccasionally meets with it. As will be noticed, the fronds grow\nin clusters or crowns. These spring from underground runners\nsent out the previous season by the older rootstocks. Hence,\nwhen the plant finds a suitable habitation, an extensive mass\nof lovely foliage is soon formed.\nFerns do not, like the flowering plants, produce seeds, but\nrather great quantities of spores, minute and dust-like. These\nspores are often borne in cases on the backs of the ordinary leaves,\nbut in other species, the one before us for example, special con¬\ntracted leaves, called fertile fronds are produced.\nFerns are an ancient race. Before the coming of any brightcolored flowers, even before the grasses, they appeared on the\nearth. They flourished in great splendor during the Carboni¬\nferous age, reaching the size of great trees. Along with giant\nclub-mosses and horsetails, they covered the interminable\nmarshes of that time, and from the tropical luxuriance of their\ngrowth resulted most of the coal beds of the world. Although\nappearing so early, perhaps millions of years before man, the\ngrace and elegance of fern foliage, even as known to us in the\nsmaller forms descended from that distant age, has never been\nsurpassed. The Fern still delights us by its charming form and\nrestful green, and the strength of its appeal is measured by the\ncertainty with which it is assured a place in our schemes of home\nand garden decoration.\n98\n\n\fQQ\n\n\fGREAT WILLOW-HERB; FIRE-WEED\nEpilobium angustifolium L.\nEve king-Pbimrose\n\nFamii.y\n\n“A goodly and stalely plant, having leaves like the greatest\nwillow - - - - garnished with brave flowers of great beau tie,\nconsisting of four leaves apiece of an orient purple color.”\nJohn Gerard, 1545-1612.\n\nGrowing to a height of three to eight feet, its stems thickly\nset with long, narrow, willow-like leaves, each stem topped by\na big spike-like raceme of bright purple blossoms, the Great\nWillow-herb is a striking and handsome feature of any landscape\nwhere it occurs.\n\nAnd its occurrence is extremely common,\n\nfor the Great Willow-herb is one of the eminently successful\nplants of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIt succeeds by endowing\n\nits numerous seed-children with almost unequalled means for\nrapid and distant travel. Hence they are always first, or amongst\nthe first, to reach land newly cleared by axe or fire, where they\nquickly cover the charred desolation with the beauty of their\nfine foliage and brilliant flowers.\nThe lower flowers on the stalk open first, and in the early\nperiod of bloom the anthers ripen and shed most of their pollen.\nDuring this time the style is bent down out of the way and the\nlobes of the still immature stigma are not yet opened.\n\nAfter\n\nthe pollen is gone the style straightens, and the four branches\nof the stigma expand to form a cross directly in front of the\ncentre of the flower.\nself-fertilization.\n\nNow this arrangement obviously prevents\n\nIt also ensures cross-fertilization by the bees\n\nFor the bees are co-workers with the flowers in this matter.\nBees always begin at the bottom of a flower-spike and work\nupward, hence\n\nwhen they leave\n\nthe\n\nnpwly-opened blossoms\n\nat the top they are well dusted with pollen.\n\nFlying to another\n\nplant, most of this pollen is rubbed off on the ripe stigmas of\ntln> lower flowers, and so the process is repeated throughout the\nbright hours of the midsummer day.\n\nThat the bees and the\n\nflowers work together effectively is shown by the heavy spike\nof long, well-filled seed pods that almost invariably results.\nFor a picture of the seed pods and some facts regarding the\ngreat buoyancy of the tiny, down-tufted seeds, the reader is\nreferred to page 128.\n\n100\n\n\fGreat Willow-herb; Fire Weed\n\n101\n\n\fGRASS OF PARNASSUS\nParnassia palustris L.\nSaxifrage Family\n\nFor a plant with short, broad leaves and showy white flowers\n“Grass of Parnassus’5 seems a strange name. It has, however,\nthe sanction of distinguished origin and ancient usage, having\nbeen applied to this very species by Dioscorides, a learned Greek\nphysician of the first and second centuries, who has been called\nthe founder of botany.\nThe entire-margined, heart-shaped leaves of the Grass of\nParnassus all spring from the rootstock, with the exception of\na single one, which clasps the stem one-third of the way to the\nflower. Bach stem, four to twelve inches high, terminates in a\nsingle white blossom an inch or so in diameter always facing\nthe sky. Although of a very common form—open, regular, and\nfive parted—these flowers have such individuality of detail that\nonce attentively observed they are not afterwards forgotten or\nconfused with others. The broad petals are clearly and hand¬\nsomely veined with light green. In front of each stands a fanshaped group of nine to fifteen slender white filaments each top¬\nped, not by an anther, but by a small yellow knob. Together the\nfive groups form a kind of grille surrounding the inner parts of\nthe flower. Since even minute details of structure are not with¬\nout use and meaning in the life of a flower, it will be an interest¬\ning problem for readers to discover what purpose is served by this\nunusual and prominent floral accessory. The centre of the flower\nis, of course, occupied by the ovary-—the immature seed capsule—\nwhich is short and round, and bears on top three or four stigmas.\nThese stigmas, however, do not ripen until late in the blooming\nperiod. Surrounding the capsule and alternate with the petals\nare five stamens whose method of development is worth watching.\nWhen the petals first expand each stamen is close-folded against\nthe capsule. Soon one of them straightens up, elongates its\nfilament, and takes a place in the centre of the flower directly\nin the way of alighting insects. Later, probably the next day,\na second stamen, ripening its pollen, acts in the same manner.\nThe other three follow suit, the anthers of the earlier ones having\nmeanwhile shed their pollen and fallen off. This deliberate\ndevelopment gives insects ample time in which to accomplish\ntheir mission of cross-fertilizaton, and full seed-pods usually\nresult.\nIn midsummer, throughout Canada to the Arctic Circle, the\nstarry blossoms of the Grass of Parnassus form constellations\nin many wet meadows, and a Milky Way around many a grassy\npool.\n10-J\n\n\fGrass or Parnassus\n\n103\n\n\fSPREADING DOGBANE; FLY-TRAP\nApocynym androsaemifolium L.\nDogbane Family\n\nAlthough placed by botanists in a separate family, the dogbanes\nare allied to the milkweeds. The same kind of milky juice\npromptly oozes from the slightest abrasion of their delicate\nskin. Both have simple leaves with entire margins, and both\nbear pods filled with down-tufted seeds; but, whereas the pods\nof the milkweeds are fat, spindle-shaped, and upright, those of\nthe dogbanes are long, slender, and drooping. In bloom also they\ndiffer, the umbelled, complex flowers of the milkweeds being\nreplaced in the dogbanes by open clusters of simple bell-shaped\nflowers.\nThe Spreading Dogbane, a common plant throughout Canada,\ngrows on wooded banks, among thickets, in fields, and along\nroadsides. Studied in these different situations, it exemplifies\nvery nicely the influence of illumination on plant form and growth.\nIn woodlands the plant is tall, and the leaves on each branch are\narranged in one plane in order to take full advantage of the\noverhead light; the flower clusters terminating the branches are\ncomparatively small, and the whole effect is that of a richlyleaved plant sparingly adorned with pretty pink blossoms. In\nfull sunlight the plant is lower and more spreading, the leaves.are\nsmaller, relatively fewer in number, and more or less twisted\nout of the horizontal plane. The flowers on the other hand are\nmuch more abundant, and often the large open clusters on the\nmore numerous branches unite to form a floral hemisphere, or\nsometimes almost a sphere within which the leaves seem of quite\nsecondary importance.\nAs might be expected, the plants growing in the open bear\nthe greater number of seed pods, for insects love the sunshine,\nand, like the milkweeds, the Spreading Dogbane is dependent\nupon their good offices for the fertilization of its flowers. It\nlias, however, a terrible way of punishing certain small flies\nwho apparenty are unable to be of service in this matter and\nyet desire the flower’s nectar. As the unwelcome visitor eagerly\nreaches for the honey, it frequently happens that his tongue is\ncaught in a notch in (he centre of the flower, and, unable to free\nhimself, the unhappy creature slowly dies of starvation. In the\nshade this tragedy is seldom seen, but in sunshine it is so common\nthat tlu' plant is sometimes called Fly-trap.\n104\n\n\fSpreading Dogbane; Fly-trap\n\n105\n\n\fCxi ANT HYSSOP\nAgcistache Foeniculum (Pursh) Kuntze\nMint Family\n\nIn midsummer the breath of the prairie is fragrant with the\nspicy odors of the mints. In midwinter, if one shake up the hay\nin the farmer’s mow, the air at once becomes redolent with the\nsame perfumes which recall to memory the warmth and color\nof the sunlit plains.\nCertain members of the family are low-set plants with small\nflowers clustered in the axils of the leaves; others, like the Wild\nBergamot described on a previous page, are taller with showy\nterminal flower-heads; still others are coarse and weedy.\nThis Giant Hyssop, a tall and handsome mint, may frequently\nbe seen on the plains, along fence rows, and among bushes from\nManitoba to Alberta. Its smooth, sharply angled stems grow\nfrom two to four feet high. Its anise-scented leaves are of marked\nbeauty, being firm in texture, triangular-ovate in outline, sharply\nand evenly toothed, dark green and strongly veined above, and\na clean white beneath. The flowers, produced over a long season,\nare borne in terminal spikes two to five inches in length. Fre¬\nquently these spikes are compact throughout, but the larger\nones may be interrupted by pairs of small leaves and short lengths\nof stem. The bright blue corollas, about two-fifths of an inch\nlong, project almost at right angles to the stem. The calyces\nare also tinted blue, and after the corollas wither and fall off this\nblue shade deepens, leaving the tall, leafy wands still conspicuous\nand decorative through the rest of the Summer.\nIt is interesting to notice that, whereas, in a simple flowerspike the blossoms open in a regular, easily recognized order,\nhere, in the spike of the Giant Hyssop, they seem to appear\nat random up and down its length. Yet for each plant there is\na master design, and it cannot be doubted that these flowers also\nopen in a definite, predetermined order. But in these dense\nspikes the scheme is not readily apparent, for we have here a\ndouble geometrical design, first in the arrangement of clusters\non the stem, and second in the arrangement of flowers in the\ncluster.\n\n106\n\n\f\fWILD MORNING GLORY; HEDGE'BINDWEED\nConvolvulus septum L.\nMorning Glory Family\n\nAnd starred with a myriad blossom the\nlong convolvulus hung—Tennyson.\n\n“.\n\nDraping banks, bushes, and fences with handsome foliage\nand beautiful trumpet-shaped flowers, the Wild Morning Glory\ntwines its graceful way from Newfoundland to British Columbia.\nIts trumpets are sometimes pink with white stripes, but in Western\nCanada they seem to be usually white, and since we have here\nthe unusual phenomenon of both pollen and pistil being white,\nthe flower is arrayed in bridal purity. In the throat of the\nflower are fine tubes in a circle (they may be readily seen in the\npicture opposite), each with a honey gland. Occasionally a big\nsphynx, or humming bird moth may be seen hovering over\nthese wells of nectar, but in Western Canada certain species of\nbees are the usual insect visitors.\nThe Morning Glory climbs by twining its stems around any\nsupport within reach. When, in the Spring, from the perennial\nroot a new shoot starts growth, its tip begins to revolve. Des¬\ncribing, as it lengthens, ever-widening circles, it seeks something\non which to ascend. If fortunate in touching anything, it at\nonce begins to entwine the support and seems by such contact\nto be stimulated to greater growth. If nothing be found, the\nshoot at length becomes so heavy that it falls prostrate, but the\ngrowing tip, like Antaeus touching the ground, finds new strength\nfrom the contact to again raise itself and swing in circles from\nthis advanced point. If several shoots chance to come together\nthey entwine each other, forming a living cable. Such cables\nmay often be seen writhing up from the ground as if in an agony\nof endeavor to reach some support. Being stiffer than a single\nstrand, they rise higher and may sometimes attain to an overhead\nbranch that would be beyond the reach of a single shoot. The\nclaim has been made that climbing plants can sense in some way\nthe proximity of a suitable support. Wonderful stories in support\nof such a claim have been told. But, on the whole, facts seem\nto discredit such a theory. The reader may easily try some\nsimple experiments which might help to decide this interesting\npoint.\n\n108\n\n\fWild Morning Glory; Hedge Bindweed\n\n109\n\n\fBLAZING STAR; BUTTON SNAIvEROOT\nLiatris scariosa Willd.\nThistle Family\n\nCommon names of plants are oft-times curious and sometimes\ninappropriate, but whoever called this one Blazing Star had a\npretty fancy. The plant grows on dry plains and hills among\nshort grasses above which the flowers shine brilliantly. On\nnearer view, the overlapping bracts of the involucre—-the scales\nsurrounding the flower-head—are seen to be dark red in color.\nAs the florets open, long style-branches of a vivid rose-purple\nare thrust out, as if from the dull smoldering glow of the bud\nhad erupted darting tongues of flame.\nAs to it?; other name, Button Snakeroot, the button is the\nglobular corm, or rootstock, an inch or so in diameter, at the base\nof the stem, and it is reputed to be a remedy for snake bites.\nrl he plants vary in height from six to eighteen inches, depending\nupon the fertility of the soil and the amount of moisture it contains.\nThey are in bloom about the first of August. The flowers are\ninteresting and unusual for this reason:—In most flowers the\nstyle is rather inconspicuous, its function being to connect the\nstigma and ovary, and to hold the stigma in the proper position\nto receive pollen according to the special method adopted by each\nplant. But in the case of the Blazing Star, although the stylebranches are stigmatose only at the base, there is a remarkable\ndevelopment carried to such a degree that it is the styles that make\nthe flowers showy, not the usual gaily-colored corollas.\n\n\fBlazing Star; Button Snakeroot\n\n111\n\n\fPAINTED CUP; INDIAN PAINT BRUSH\nCastilleja miniata Dougl.\nFigwort Family\n\nThat the Figwort family contains many floral oddities is\nevidenced by the common names of some of its members, such as\nsnapdragon, turtle-head, monkey-flower, owl’s clover, elephant’s\nhead and so on. Nor are these names so wildly fanciful, since\nthe resemblances are sometimes very real. In the elephant’s\nhead for instance, each tiny flower on the long, slender spike\nimitates the broad spreading ears and the upturned trunk of the\nelephant in a remarkable manner.\nThe Painted Cup, a familiar plant from Manitoba to the\nRockies, is curious in a different way. The flowers are borne\nin dense leafy spikes at the top of a leafy stem, but, being greenishyellow in color, they are scarcely noticeable among the longer\nand more brilliantly colored bracts, which look as if they had\nbeen dipped in a pot of scarlet paint. Its other common name—\nIndian Paint Brush—is therefore more appropriate than Painted\nCup. Still, the color of the bracts varies greatly, not only in\nthe several species found in Western Canada, but also among\ndifferent individuals of the same species, ranging from scarlet\nand brick-red to rose, pink, and even to white. Individually,\nthe plants are rather coarse but in the mass their effect is beautiful,\nand many a hillside and prairie seems aflame with them.\nNot the least interesting fact in the life of the paint brush\nis its deviation from what one might call the standards of common\nhonesty in plant life. For frequently this plant attaches itself\nto the roots of other plants and steals from them their life juices.\nIn short, it seems to be by instinct, if not always by opportunity,\na parasite. Still its moral declension is not complete. For in\nthe case of those plants which are wholly parasitic in nature their\nlow character is usually revealed by the absence of green color\nin their leaves. But where, as with the paint brush, the theft\nis incidental, as it were, where the plant can, and to a certain extent\ndoes, live by its own exertions there is usually little outward\nsign of this brand of degeneracy.\n\n\fPainted Cup;\n\nIndian Paint Brush\n\n113\n\n\fA WESTERN RIVER SCENE\n\"But there is one thing a large river does for one that is beyond\nthe scope of the companionable stream,—it idealizes the landscape,\nit multiplies and heightens the beauty of the day and of the season.\nA fair day it makes more fair, and a wild and tempestuous day it\nmakes more ivild and tempestuous. It lakes on so quickly and\ncompletely the mood and temper of the sky above _\nflow it\nenhances and emphasizes the beauty of those calm motionless\ndays of Summer or Fall,—the broad glassy surface perfectly dupli¬\ncating the opposite shore, sometimes so smooth that the finer floating\nmatter here and there looks like dust upon a mirror;—”\n—John B urroughs.\n\nNot always is the river so placid as in our picture. When\nsummer heat melts the snow on the mountains, and summer\nrains along its great length swell the flood, the water rises rapidly\nand sweeps along in swelling strength chafing at its steep day\nbanks and carrying away soil and plants that are not firmly\nanchored.\nHence, we find that the perennial plants that grow\non these steep river banks are either grasses with numerous\nintertwining rootstocks firmly binding together the soil, or else\nplants that have deep and strong roots, like Hooker’s mugwort,\nshown in the foreground of our picture, Mackenzie’s hedysarum,\nthe deflexed oxytrope, and other herbs of like habit. Sometimes\nseveral inches of surface soil will be carried away from the tap\nroots of these plants and the roots with their tufted stems hang\ndown, dirty and forlorn. Hut abatement of the flood brings\nrestoration to air and sunshine. The leaves quickly resume\ntheir interrupted functions, the stems bend upward hopefully,\nand soon the bank is again clothed with clean, fresh verdure.\n\nIll\n\n\fA Western River Scene\n\n115\n\n\fGIANT SUNFLOWER\nHelianthus giganteus L.\nThistle Family\n\nThe Giant Sunflower is so called because of its tall stems\nwhich sometimes grow ten feet high, although half that height\nor less is commoner. As compared with the thick stems, broad\nleaves, and massive heads of the cultivated Russian sunflower,\nit is not at all gigantic, for its stem is usually much branched and,\nexcept at the base, rather slender, its leaves narrow and taperpointed, and its flower-heads only two or two-and-a-half inches\nacross. Still it is a big, vigorous plant and with such a capacity\nfor spreading and massing that it may often become a troublesome\nweed in low ground. From the Lake of the Woods to the Rockies,\nthe Giant Sunflower is abundant and furnishes in many a mid¬\nsummer landscape great expanses of radiant color.\nIf a stem of this big herb be dug up in Autumn it will bring\nwith it a great cluster of roots. Some are ordinary feeding and\nanchoring roots, others are so thickened as to look like small\nsweet potatoes. From among these, spreading out in all directions,\nare stout creeping rootstocks. In these spindle-shaped tubers\nis stored concentrated building material upon which the runners\ndraw in early Spring, so getting a good start in their work of\nextending the sunflower colony.\n\n\fGiant Sunflower\n\n117\n\n\fbroad-leaved arrow-head\nSagittaria latifolia Willd.\nWater-plantain Famiio'\n\n,\n, nt is the Arrow-head with distinctive and\nA handsome Plant\ng\nGrowing in shallow water or mud,\ndecorative leaves and flo\n•\nft occurs commonly\nalong the margins of ponds and streams\nand often abundantly throug mu\ncontinent.

Nels.\nGentian Family\n\nThis plant is probably an unfamiliar one to many of our\nreaders. It is said by the late Mr. J. M. Macoun to be character¬\nistic of alkali flats in the southern part of the prairie country,\nand Rydberg’s Flora gives its habitat as mountain bogs. The\nplants pictured on the opposite page grew hundreds of miles\nfrom the international boundary and far from the mountains,\nand it probably occurs on brackish shores and in salt marshes\nover a wide range.\nOne reason why it is little known is its habit of opening its\nflowers in bright sunshine only, and then for but a short time.\nAnother is that its usual rather desolate surroundings do not\npromise the flower lover much in the way of floral beauty, and lie\nis likely to turn to more fertile fields. Finally, it is a capricious\nannual and may appear in a neighborhood one season and then\nnot to be seen again for several succeeding years. In this latter\nelusive quality it resembles its beautiful relative the fringed\ngentian whose flowers of heavenly blue have captivated alike\nthe poet and the artist.\nIndividual plants of the Marsh Felwort, even when growing\ntogether, differ curiously in size. Some are three or four inches\nhigh bearing but one or two blossoms, each slender stem bending\nto the lightest breeze. Others grow to a height of fifteen inches\nand are stiffly erect with a dozen or more close-set flowers. The\nwhite corolla is so deeply cleft into four or five lobes, that each\nseems to be a separate petal. At first sight, also, the flower\nseems to have neither style nor stigmas. The style is indeed\nlacking, but closer examination will revel the latter as stigmatose\nlines on the sides of the ovary—quite an unusual arrangement.\nThe flowers open in late Summer and it is always a pleasant\nsurprise to find such pure and delicate beauty amid the usual\ncoarse vegetation of its environment.\n\n120\n\n\f\fLESSER PASTURE SAGE BRUSH; WORMWOOD\nSAGE\nA rtemisia frigida WHid.\nThistle Family?\n\nIn Western Canada grow many species of Artemisia, known\nvariously as wormwoods, sage brushes, or mugworts. Most of\nthem are dry ground plants, a few are found in moist valleys,\nand one at least (A. biennis) has become in many places a common\nand unsightly weed. Certain kinds, especially the European\nwormwood (A. Absinthium) grown in many gardens and escaped\nfrom them to the roadside, are so widely used as domestic medicine\nthat “wormwood tea is an odorous memory with every person\nwho was reared in the country.”*\nThose species of Artemisia commonly called sage brushes\nare characteristic of arid regions, where over large tracts they\nsometimes constitute almost the entire vegetation. We have all\nheard of, even if we have not seen, the sage brush desert whose\ngray monotony impresses travellers as they cross the continent\nby southern railway lines. Such universal grayness of tone is\ndue to the fact that stems, leaves, and flower-heads of these plants\nare all densely coated with white hair or wool. The protection\nthus afforded is two-fold: first, transpiration is greatly diminished;\nand, second, the chlorophyll—the green coloring matter of plants\nin the tissue beneath the hairs—is shaded as by an awning from\nthe destructive action of too intense sunshine.\nThe Lesser Pasture Sage Brush pictured on the opposite page\nis one of the smaller of these desert sages. It has, however, a\nrange extending far beyond the desert, being found northward as\nfar as Hudson’s Bay and Alaska. Over much of this great\nexpanse it occurs sparingly in small colonies on particularly dry\nbanks or hillsides, but in the arid part of the Canadian plains it\nsometimes covers the ground over considerable areas.\nConsidered, not as a hundred or a thousand acre carpet,\nbut individually in detail, it is a pretty plant with soft masses of\nfinely-cut, silvery foliage above which in late Summer rise silvery\nPlumes eight to twenty inches high. Along the slender branches\nof these stems are strung round and nodding flower-heads, pearly\ngray on the outside, but soon opening to emit the tiny yellow\nflorets.\n‘Liberty Hyde Bailey.\n\n122\n\n\f\fWHITE PRAIRIE ASTER\nAster commutatis T. and G.\nThisti.f. Family\n\nIn the floral pageantry of early summer the Asters take no\npart, but from midsummer onward they demand increasing\nnotice until in the climax of splendor with which the season\ncloses they occupy the premier place. Other handsome flowers\nin great number and variety join in the display, but many of\nthem furnish only here and there outstanding points of color,\nvaluable additions to the general effect, but still merely inci¬\ndental. Not so the Asters! Vast plains, unending miles of road¬\nway, and innumerable swamps, thickets, and forest glades are\nbeautified by their myriad blossoms.\nAsters respond kindly to human care, and in England these\nMichaelmas daisies, as they are called, are highly esteemed and\ngenerally cultivated. In Canada little attention of this kind\nhas yet been paid to them. But, although neglected by human\ngardeners, Nature here uses them lavishly, and many a lonely\nsettler’s simple home is transformed and glorified by the blue\nand white of asters and the yellow of goldenrods.\nThis White Prairie Aster is common in dry and sandy soil\nfrom Manitoba to British Columbia.\nIts stem, somewhat\nbranched, grows one or two feet high, its leaves are small and\nnarrow, both stem and leaves are hairy, but one notices little\nsuch details, as attention is centred upon the splendid panicle\nof white flowers, a particularly fine specimen of which is shown\non the opposite page.\nA closely allied species, the White Wreath Aster (A. nndtiflorus) with smaller flower-heads and a more branched stem,\ngrows in similar soil over an even wider territory.\nThe Smooth-leaved Aster (A. laevis) with rather compact\npanicles of sky-blue flowers is one of the most abundant and\nelegant forms in open woods, on the edge of thickets, and along\nfence rows.\nIn swamps we frequently find a stout, rough-hairv, purple¬\nstemmed Aster (A. puniceus) bearing aloft above the tallest\nsedges a great pyramid of large lilac-blue flowers.\nScattered along hilly roads and on openly wooded hillsides is\nthe Showy Western Aster (A. cons-picuus) whose broad leaves\nand flat-topped clusters of large violet or pink-purple flowers\nquite justify its name.\nMany other kinds merit mention.\nThe ambitious young\nstudent may find some difficulty in the exact determination\nof species, but both he and the amateur lover of flowers will\nfind interest and pleasure in their great variety and beauty.\n\n124\n\n\f\fDRUMMOND’S DRYAS FRUITING ON A\nGRAVEL-BAR\nDryas Drummondii Richards\nRose Family\n\nHaving now considered many flowers, it seems fitting that,\nbefore bringing this series to a close, we should glance at a few\nof the seeds, or fruits as a botanist calls them, the production\nof which is the object of all blossoms.\nOur photograph of Drummond’s Dryas, fruiting on a gravelbar of a great northern river, was chosen because it illustrates\nso well the frequent beauty of this final stage in plant growth,\nand also the lavish manner in which seeds are usually produced.\nThis plant forms dense mats of foliage above which in early\nSummer rise small, short-stemmed flowers. The petals wither,\nand the numerous styles afterwards elongate into twisted awns,\nfringed throughout their length with fine hairs. While still\nimmature these styles are tightly twisted together, but when\nripe they fluff out into a downy ball two inches or more in diameter.\nThe seed-stems lengthen to eight or ten inches, thus raising the\nseed-heads well above the leaves.\nAs to the beauty of such a Dryas bed there can be no question.\nThe soft, feathery expanse of plumose seeds gleaming in the\nsunshine quite surpasses in attractiveness the same bed when\ndotted with small yellow flowers. And since this one colony shows\nthousands of seed-heads, and each head has about one hundred\nand fifty seeds, some idea of the great quantity of seed produced\nis readily formed.\nBut, when the individual plant has ripened a good crop of seed,\nthe achievement will be of little benefit to the race unless the seeds\nreach a place where they can grow successfully. If they fall\ndirectly to the ground, t hen, in t he case of all perennials, the parent\nitself becomes the chief danger to its offspring. Plants, therefore,\nhave developed many devices to scatter their seeds abroad.\nAs is fitting, these Dryas seeds, born beside the water, arc good\nswimmers. 1 hey are also able to fly, although not with the\nbuoyancy of thistle-down. Using both modes of travel, they\nquickly reach and triumphantly occupy the gravel-bars on\nthousands of miles of northern waterways.\n\n\f\fA GROUP OF AIRSHIP SEEDS\nReady to start on the great adventure\nOf the many methods of seed dispersion that of using the\nwind as carrier is one of the most common and most effective.\nIn the picture opposite we have an interesting group of such\nairship seeds.\n\nThe centre is occupied by a spike of the great\n\nwillow-herb, or fireweed, whose forty long pods contained about\ntwelve thousand seeds\n\nOn a dry day it is a pretty sight to see\n\nthese pods splitting open, their four slender divisions cur'v ing\nquickly but gently outward into the form of a cross, and the\nimprisoned down instantly fluffing out as if delighted to find\nfreedom.\n\nThe seeds lose no time in starting on their momentous\n\njourney, but eagerly commit themselves to the first passing breeze.\nThe launching of these tiny, crowded airships is in open situations\nusually attended by few mishaps, and away they sail, each freighted\nwith a potential fireweed that may by and by bloom in splendor\non some distant clearing.\nbuoyant.\n\nThese seeds are extremely light and\n\nTwelve hundred of them weigh less than one grain,\n\nand in a still room, experiment showed that on the average the\nseeds took forty seconds to fall eight feet.\n\nThe slightest upward\n\nbreath of air sent them soaring, and in the open there is no doubt\nthat they rise to great heights and travel long distances.\nOn the left of our picture are opened milkweed pods.\nheld about fifty large, brown seeds.\n\nEach\n\nThese pods split open along\n\none side only, and at first no silk is seen, for the flat seeds o\\eilap\none another like the scales of a spruce cone, but as drying pro¬\ngresses the elasticity of the compressed hairs pushes up and out\nseed after seed to be whirled away by the wind.\n\nThe weight of\n\neach is more than one hundred times that of a fireweed seed, yet\nthe sustaining power of its large and beautiful parachute is such\nthat it has one-fifth the buoyancy of the lighter seed.\nTo the right are five disintegrating cylinders of the longfruited anemone.\n\nWhile still intact, all the seeds\n\nabout two\n\nhundred and forty to each—are on the outside, arranged in wellordered spirals with the wool tightly packed within.\n\nW hen the\n\nexpansive pressure of this drying wool finally bursts the neat\ncylinder, the crinkly wool separates into little tufts with a seed\n\n\f\fin the centre of each.\n\nThese weigh fifteen times as much as,\n\nand have one-eighth the bouyancy of the fireweed seeds.\nIn the lower right hand corner are two heads of Troximon,\nan artistic ally of the dandelion.\n\nAt the bottom are three globes\n\nof the dandelion itself, and above them the half-dozen small\nheads are those of the golden aster.\n\nThese three plants belong\n\nto the Thistle family and serve to illustrate the fruiting method\nof many of their kindred.\n\nAs the dandelion, especially, is so well-\n\nknown it is unnecessary to describe this method in detail.\n\nEvery\n\nchild has played with dandelion “clocks’' and watched the seeds\nsail away before his vigorous puffs.\n\nThe dandelion seeds are\n\nquite light—about four hundred of them weigh one grain—\nand yet in a quiet room their buoyancy is only about one-tenth\nthat of the fireweed seeds.\nThis comparison suggests that other factors play a part in\nthe successful spread of a species.\n\nFrom a close, hard fight the\n\nfireweed flies far away to seek easier conditions elsewhere, but the\ndandelion stays and fights it out, successfully competing with\neven blue-grass sod, and dodging serious lawn-mower injury by\nspreading its leaves flat and bearing its flowers on very short\nstems.\nand\n\nThen, just when the seeds are ripe, the stems shoot up\n\nlift\n\nthe seed-heads well above the grass.\n\nThe dandelion\n\nseed may not travel so far as that of the fireweed, but it will\ngerminate and thrive where the latter would perish.\nHere we must leave this interesting subject.\nhowever,\n\nmay by observation\n\ncontinue its investigation.\n\nand\n\nThe reader,\n\nsimple experiment easily\n\n\fINDEX\nPage\nAgastache Focniculum.\nAirship Seeds.\nA Ilium cernuum.\n\nPage\n\n....\n....\n\n106\n128\n88\nAnemone, Long-fruited.

It was the successor to the Prince of Wales College Times and the St. Dunstan&apos;s University Red and White, both of which institutions were amalgamated to form U.P.E.I. in 1969. The Cadre printed U.P.E.I. news and sports, news from other universities and strongly worded articles on current social issues. Photographs were printed in every issue. The Cadre supported student rights, sexual freedom and women's liberation. It attacked capitalism, Christianity and the Canadian university system. Issues of particular concern included unemployment, inflation and the high cost of tuition. The Cadre became less radical and critical towards the end of its publication history. It was succeeded by the UPEI Sun in the fall of 1977.

In five years Holland College\nis expected to be larger than the university ; possibly UPEI\nwill have become a liberal arts wing of the college. This year\nthe per capita subsidy given to Holland College students is\nmore than double that given UPEI students — $3, 750 to 1,731.\n\nWe are pleased that the college should prosper, but not at the\nexpense of the university.\n\nIf we can’t afford a good university on Prince Edward\nIsland, let’s not have one at all.\n\nWe don’t feel that most people on P.E.I. can afford the\nextra costs that are scheduled to be imposed next year.\n\nAnd are we getting our money’s worth now? The facili-\nties offered by way of residence accommodation (including\nfood), vary considerably. Some students get better food than\nothers. Some get better rooms than others. A figure of $625\nhas been quoted as the amount that each student in residence\nis subsidized. Obviously a person living in Bernadine or Monty\nis subsidized more than a person living in Dalton or Main.\nBut everyone pays the same.\n\nSome departments like Sociology and Psychology are in\ndire need of more, and in some cases better qualified staff.\n\nAnd next year it appears that you will be paying more\nand getting less. We have heard that no capital expenditures\nare planned, that departmental budgets are being cut, that\nthe student to faculty ratio is going to rise and that students\nwill have to pay for varsity athletics.\n\nSome comparisons with other universities: Memorial Uni-\nversity in Nfld. has a tuition of $500 and a residence fee of\n$700; University of Victoria has tuition of $429 and a resi-\ndence fee of $682; University of Winnipeg has a tuition of\n$425 and a residence fee of $611. Although there are more\nexpensive universities than UPEI students there get more for\ntheir money and are more able to pay higher fees because of\ngovernment aid. Our cost imbalance must be rectified.\n\nHere is the resolution passed by the students Monday\nnight ; “Moved that the university of P.E.I. student body wait\nuntil Premier Campbell and the university administration give\nthe facts relevant to the fee increases. After receiving these\nfacts, the students wil analyze them and decide upon subse-\n\nquent action if any. We also affirm our belief that education\nis a right and not a privilege.”\n\nStudents must be prepared to insist on concrete and rea-\nlistic answers to these questions. We have had enough of\nwishy-washiness and evasions.\n\n—The Editors.\n    metadata/dublin_core.xml  ddc1fb3b3ce9d4b8e92509c51b3ade76152ef45cb7f47e9e22ef9115feee20baa555601ed430efaffd645d32679fc36ecf54aaddabf619495522299563f7848e  d7ed70b9fbbe67c37482f21ff5f8b39b7107e064550bc5aa7a35677d7d190ba66816c4a6106799293f46ccf9bbacfbd5df297163bc6abc390033f1e40727a9ec  fb2a1e9ea62d00f5b3c276c5d957829806c0b1791f3578475a9d51c0747ea44d5da6b7ce511c8e9cc4bcea0823ccb40e029047ea98ab50162d8eca74794019a7  43faa795254f39e77abaf9d32c8b6310b0be69b358ae22550c29fa4683d4899485da34ef74993ccf013100d9dab0f071946a5694b7807f94db520f26f6a77f64  /islandora/object/176/index.html  "

E. 1\n\nJANUARY 21, 1969\n\nThe Council Resolution\n\nAs most students know by now, the Board of Governors last October\npassed resolutions calling for a $100 dollar increase in both reidence and tui-\ntion fees. A mass meeting planned for tonight (Wednesday) in the Malpeque\nGym. Questions are being asked as to why this is deemed necessary in the\nlight of the fact that in the next fifteen years 69 million dollars is slated for\nexpenditures on the University, 30 million on Holland College and 18 million\ndollars for a program of student aid. Many comparisons are being made with\nother institutions; many promises have been made. We are presenting the\ninformation we could find in an effort to provide a background to the meet-\ning, at which it is hoped that President Baker, the Deans of Arts and Science,\nrepresentatives from the Board of Governors and Education Minister Ben-\n\nnett, will attend.\n\nIt is up to you the student to question the priorities the government has\nset and get concrete answers to why the Administration intends to take\n$327,000 more from the student body than it did this year.\n\nWHEREAS — The action taken concerning the\nraise in tuition and residence fees has taken place\nwithout student consultation.\n\nLast October the Board of Governors of UPEI\nmet and unanimously passed a resolution that will\nincrease the tuition at this University from $450\nto $550 and the Residence fee from the present\n675 to $775. For some reason it was decided by\nthe Board not to make this public. It was approx-\nimately a week ago that students began to find out.\nNo information was given to the Students Council\nby the Board or by the President of the University.\nWhen questioned about the action they were going\nto take with regards to the fee hike, Council mem-\nbers seemed a bit surprised. John Keaveny, Presi-\ndent of the Union had not heard anything about the\nfee increase. Some students heard a CBCT pro-\ngram on which President Baker announced the in-\ncreases, or from a story in last Thursday’s Journal-\n\nPioneer.\n\nThis type of treatment must not be tolerated\nby the students. It is bad enough that students and\ntheir representatives on Council were not consulted,\nbut to not even be officially informed about the\nBoard’s action is an insult to the student body.\n\nWhen asked why the Union was not officially\ninformed, President Baker said that he felt students\nwould find out anyway.\n\nWHEREAS — the government’s promised bursary\nsystem hasn’t as yet materialized, and from all in-\nformation available isn’t planned to coincide with\nthe fee hikes.\n\n“The essential ingredients of this program will\ninclude the following:\n\nA program of student aid, including bursaries\nand scholarships. The aim will be to have about\n1,200 new students participating by the year 1978.\nThe total cost of this student assistance is estimat-\ned at $18 million over the next ten years.\n\n—Policy Statement on Post-Secondary Education\nApril 2, 1968\n\nAlready the promised system of scholarships\nand bursaries is two years late from when it was\npromised in the 1968 White Paper. And we have\nbeen told in confidence by a highly knowledgeable\ngovernment official that the financial aid system\n\nWILL NOT be in effect for 1970-71.\n\nIn a telephone interview, Education Minister\nGordon Bennett said that he was “optimistic” that\nthe plan would be in effect for next year; he stated\nthat such a system was in his department’s esti-\nmate for the coming year, although he would not\nreveal the amount of this figure.\n\nThe buck was passed to the Treasury Board\nas to whether or not it will be passed — Bennett\nsaid “they decide what we do with the ‘dollars.”\n(By way of explanation, a budget submission frpm\nthe university must pass through seven screening\nsessions before it passes. They are, in order, the\nPost-Secondary Commission, the Minister of Educa-\ntion, the Education Committee, the Government\nBudget Committee, the Treasury Board, the Fed-\n\neral-Provincial Advisory Board, and the Legislative\nAssembly of this province.)\n\nAnother interesting note is that on CBCT De-\ncgmber 5, 1969, Bennett mentioned a plan to pro-\nvide $400,000 a year in assistance to post-secondary\nstudepts. Taken over fifteen years (the ostensible\nduration of the plan) that amounts to SIX, not\nEIGHTEEN million dollars!\n\nHe feels that loans are better than outright\ngrants. One suggestion that has been made is that\nrepayment rates on loans be determined by the\nearnings of the students after graduation.\n\nThat’s fine if you don’t mind debts hanging\nover you when you graduate.\n\nG, The only way anything like ‘“universal acces-\nibility” to university, or anything like it, will be\nachieved with the economic resources of the people\non the Island considered, is an absolute rock-bottom\nlevel of fees, (if any).\n\n. And even if bursaries and scholarships are\ngiven, not everybody will get one. But everybody\ngets the fee hikes.\n\n“...AS I HAVE SAID, PROJECTIONS OF\nPRESENT COSTS SUGGEST THAT SUBSTAN-\nTIAL INCREASES IN UNIVERSITY REVENUES\nARE GOING TO BE NEEDED, AND IT IS IN-\nCREASINGLY CLEAR THAT THESE REVENUES\nMUST COME FROM THE PROVINCIAL GOV-\nERNMENT.”\n\n—Policy Statement on Post-Secondary Education\nApril 2, 1968.\n\nAt their last meeting the UPEI Student Council\nstated as part of a motion concerning the fee in-\ncrease that “The students cannot realistically afford\nto pay these higher fees due to the economic con-\nditions they find themselves in”. This is a self-\nevident fact and almost any discussion is redundant.\nOur Government recognizes this, therefore the De-\nvelopment Plan one must only look at the low per\ncapita income, lack of employment and the low\nwages to see how true the Councils statement was.\nUnfortunately the Board of Governors and the Pro-\nvincial Government must feel that students must\nbe somehow apart from the Island community thus\nable to take the fee increase in stride. According\nto our calculations, allowing for the lack of finan-\ncial aid available except the student loan, it will\nbe very difficult for students to raise the necessary\n$1800 - $2000 necessary to attend UPEI next year.\nIt will cost less than this if you are living at home,\nbut then you will be allowed less student loan.\n\nCommenting to us on the fee increase, George\nKey, Leader of the Island P.C. Party said, “It is a\nsad commentary on the establishment of a new uni-\nversity of this size, that increase are felt necessary\nat this early date.”\n\nWHEREAS — Information concerning the future\nof UPEI is not available and hence places the stud-\nent and faculty members in significant jeopardy\nconcerning his academic future...\n\nRequests for information on planned expendi-\ntures and long range plans, are met with refusals\n\nExplained:\n\n“This single university will be on a scale suf-\nficient to enable more Islanders to obtain high\nquality education comparable to national stan-\ndards.”\n\n—Premier Campbell,\nApril 2, 1968.\n\nto divulge this information. Rumors are flying, sev-\neral suggest that in 5 or 10 years UPEI will be\nphased out in favor of Holland College, that it will\neither be a liberal arts wing of the College or the\nold St. Dunstan’s board will try to set up SDU again.\nDoes the Government want Holland College to dom-\nminate the University because it trains people who\nin the short run will more directly serve the needs\nof the Island?\n\nIf the Island cannot afford a GOOD university\nthen let’s get rid of it now and not let it slowly\nsuffocate over the next 10 or 15 years.\n\n“EVERY THING SECRET DEGENERATES;\nNOTHING IS SAFE THAT DOES NOT SHOW IT\nCAN BEAR DISCUSSION AND PUBLICIY —\n\nLord Acton.\n\nWHEREAS — Education is a right and not a priv-\nilege and increasing fees will not only serve to limit\nthe accesibility of those citizens of P.E.L. to higher\neducation in their home province. :\n\nIn the last paragraph of the Declaration of the\nCanadian Student it is stated that “The Canadian\nstudent has the right to be free, to continue his\neducation without any material, economic or social\nbarriers, created by the abscence of real equality\nof essential conditions.”\n\nWhat this quote says is merely that education\nis a right just like freedom of speech, not a privilege\nwhich is determined by how much money your par-\nents have. .In a survey taken by the Canadian Un-\nion of Students (CUS), in 1965, it was found that\nparental income of 25% of the respondents in the\nsurvey was $10,000 whereas the national percentage\nof parental income over $10,000 was only 6.1%. The\nlower 54%. of the Canadian income earmers, those\nearning under $5,000, were the parents of only 28%\nof the respondents. While our parents in general\nare by no means “well off”, according to Omtario\nstandards, we must realize that by Island standards\nthe students who attend university are in general\nfrom the upper middle class families.\n\nEducation at present being a privilege is ‘ghe\nsituation which should exist in a “truly democratic”\nsociety.\n\nWhen asked whether or not he felt education\nwas a right or a privilege Bennett said he felt,\n“education at the post-secondary level was a priv-\nilege enjoyed by many young people’’, which, in our\nopinion is hardly an inspiring or even satisfactory\nstatement of educational philosophy.\n\nPeople should not be denied a university\neducation if they qualify. Therefore, while we are\npresently involved in a fight not to have fees go\nhigher we must realize that our goal is free edu-\ncation for anyone who qualifies academically.\n\nwith this in mind the UPEISU Inc. formally\nrequests the following people to be present at a\n\nmeeting of the entire student body at 8:00 p.m.\nGym — Malpeque. These People:\n\nREPRESENTATIVES FROM THE BOARD.\nPRESIDENT OF UPEI\nDEANS OF ARTS AND SCIENCE\n\nS\n    metadata/dublin_core.xml  0d245fed2385de5e7169a632a749219a8218f39fe8bd14cb78842423c86bdeab5658e2304e5be9823a8d6f2f29c670b3731b4a618d9b7009c912c15d07e7c1d6  071a8f4f9d4201e6d7ef6fd5f611162e7d0cbba283650e350484200dec376dff4c5c876183b26e9969a0d7fe09cc8704ea9136efc269c4867868591762ec97c5  253626bcd16efe5ea80db7f49f289a240b586676004490db3be364f496f7ebc2486091d563c72ca95a329b49955ef8798dd30bcb49499c49f7e671c97d228dd6  006175d5741420da3b2966062abdc4bc07561b163084ed76bb0db5db83de442c7ee6a50337c494aa637608bd4fb09b8193c26facd621ac4d87734bfc92a1fc33  /islandora/object/179/index.html  "

Poverty Committee meefing Monday night at the Basilica Recreation\n\nCentre at 8:00 o’clock.\n\n(Maclean photo)\n\nSTUDENTS WILL ADVISE DEPARTMENTS\n\nRecently there has been a\nmove within some of the de-\npartments at UPEI to allow\nstudents to participate in de-\npartmental decision-making.\n\nProfessor Smitheram of the\n\nPhilosophy Department dis-\nclosed that two students with\nfull voting rights will be\n\nprofessor.\n\nCOMPULSORY\n\nThe UPEVI senate has decreed that all students shall\ntake Christmas examinations, and that the mode and\nrecording of evaluation will be done ‘by the individual\n\nXMAS EXAMS\n\n~ The November 19 meeting also decided that grades\ngiven by professors should be easily convertible into a\ns‘ySte'xnv which will be used by the_ registrar’s office.\nThe new grading system will use the letters A, B, C,\nD and F instead pnf number grades.\n\nIt was also decided that exams in non-terminal\ncourses should not take place after December 10, and that\n~exams in terminal courses be held no later than Dec. 16.\n\nelected December 5. They\nwill help decide what type of\nrepresentation students wish,\nthe agreed-upon number will\nthen aid in departmental de-\ncision-making.\n\nThe Economics Department\n\nsays that they are working\nthrough an economics club,\n\nwhich is discussing the pos-\nsibility of students with full\nvoting rights participating in\ndepartmental meetings. No-\nbody participated in the first\norganizational meeting that\nwas called, but Professor\nO’Connell stated that another\nmeeting would be called soon.\n\nEnglish Department head\nDr. Coyle said “We are con-\nsidering it”, when asked if\nstudents would take part in\na_decision-making process.\nHe feels that a Major’s asso-\nciation might be feasible\nwhere students could partici-\npate, but not make depart-\nmental policy.\n\nIn the Physics Department,\nsix students were asked to\nparticipate in decision-mak-\ning along with faculty.\n\nBusiness students are al-\nready involved in decision-\nmaking through a departmen-\ntal society, said Business\nprofessor Mr. Revell, who\nfurther stated that there\nshould be little disagreement\nbetween students and faculty,\nas both had common goals.\nHe said that at the present\ntime, numbers of representa-\ntives were not considered.\n\nby mike mecgaughey\n\nThe controversial Educa-\ntion Committee Budget was\nstill the topic of debate at a\nrecord six-hour council meet-\ning at Duffy Auditorium last\nWednesday.\n\nThe cause of it all was a\npetition which was presented\nto council by a student group\ncalled “The nc-longer Silent\nMajority” which wished dras-\ntic amendments to the Com-\nmittee’s budget.\n\nThe 379 - name petition re-\ncommended that certain pro-\njects could be handled better\nby other agencies than an\nEducation committee. Fear\nwas also expressed that the\ncommittee’s program would\nbecome “leftist” oriented, and\nrecommended that commit-\ntee programs and finances be\ndirectly under council con-\ntrol.\n\nThe petition also expressed\nconcern that the Education\nCommittee was attempting\nto claim that they were re-\npresentative of the entire\nstudent body and that its\nfounders were “known Left-\nists”’, whose programs might\nprove detrimental to the stu-\ndent body.\n\nThe real battle began when\npetition spokesman Paul Poir-\nier attempted to have the\npetition passed intact by\ncouncil. The motion was de-\nfeated, and council proceeded\nto debate the petition’s claus-\nes section by section. A five-\nhour marathon debate follow-\ned which lasted almost until\n4 o’clock the next morning.\n\nAccusations and insults\nwere exchanged by both fac-\n\nU\n\nARCHIVES\n\n“meet\n\ntions as debate began, and at\none point President John\nKeaveny was forced by coun-\ncil to retract a statement he\nmade against supporters of\nthe petition. Supporters of\nboth sides refused compro-\nmise conditions, which con-\ntinually prevented any defin-\nite conclusion.\n\nIn the midst of the debate,\nPresident Keaveny asked for\npermission to bring up the\nsuggestion that he resign.\nSeconded by Poirier, council\naccepted the suggestion, and\nPoirier read Keaveny’s re-\nquest that he be relieved of\nthe Presidency.\n\nIn the letter, Keaveny said\nthat he felt he no longer\ncould command the -confi-\ndence of the student body and\nasked that the council care-\nfully consider its decision\nwhether or not to accept his\nresignation,\n\nAfter a lengthy debat e,\ncouncil rejected Keaveny’s re-\nquest and expressed a vote of\nconfidence for his policies and\nactions as President. Several\nobservers felt Keaveny was\ntrying to force through his\nmeasures by threatened re-\nsignation.\n\nDebate then continued on\nthe Education Budget until\n3 a.m. when the budget was\nfing,ll.y accepted with minor\nrevisions.\n\nThe remaining period was\nused to discuss several other\nbudget proposals. The Engin-\neering Society Budget was\nchopped from $800 to $300,\nand plans for a feasibility\nstudy of a Radio UPEI and\na Student Union Building\nwere passed.\n\nMacKAY WALKS ouT\nOF SENATE\n\nby marjorie stevenson\n\nA second student senator\nmay resign from TUPEI’s\nacademic Senate.\n\nSenior student Dennis Mac-\nKay walked out of Wednes-\nday’s Senate meeting after\nstating “If senate doesn’t be-\nlieve that students have\nenough experience to handle\nSenate problems ... then\nthey shouldn’t be allowed on\nSenate.”\n\nHe was referring to a Sen-\nate initial rejection of stud-\nent-faculty parity on the\nStudent - Faculty Academic\nPlanning Committee. Discus-\nsion on this topic ensued af-\nter his departure. The nom-\ninating committee later re-\ncommended that the student\nadvisory committee be com-\nposed of two administration,\n*twgs faculty, and four stud-\nents.\n\nMr. MacKay was unavail-\nable for comment, but is be-\nlieved to have re-considered\nhis actions and may return\nto the Senate at its request.\n\nPresident Baker introduc-\ned the information that the\nBoard of Governors has ruled\nthat all non-academie regula-\ntions will fall under Senate\njurisdiction.

If there was ever a time\nfor this, it must be today. Never has the\nworld been faced with so many problems. Of\ncourse we have made progress in a material\nway, but these advances seem to have merely\nhelped outline more clearly the contradiction\n\nupon which we live.\n\nHow many students and faculty have\nasked such questions as “What do we do with\nour lives?”, “What alternatives do we have?”,\nor “What is the quality and character of our\n\nsociety ?”\n\nThe answers I received when I asked\nthese questions did not make me happy. One\nof my professors read a report on youth in\nclass the other day which said the young\npeople did not have much hope in the future.\nWell, how the hell could they? — just look\naround at our polluted, hysterical, mentally-\n\ndiseased world.\n\nOur society is a drab and dreary mono-\ntonous grey which wastes our potential and\ncrushes our spirit. I come from King’s Coun-\nty: P.E.L, and I see there many people who\ndo not live, but exist. Just open your eyes\nand you can see the failings of our society,\nboth in a material and mental sense. Look\ninto the eyes of these people, and you can see\nhelplessness and dispair. '\n\nBasically we are confronted ‘with an ap-\npalling paradox — a supreme irony — in that\non one hand there is the reality of suppres-\nsion, deprivation, secareity, and suffering;\nwhile on the other there is the possibility of\nmaterial plenty, spiritual recreation, human\nliberation, and self-realization.\n\nWhile things do not look bright for the\nfuture, there is still the possibility that they\ncan be. We, as students, can do something\nabout it — we have a responsibility; to our\nparents, to our children, and to ourselves, to\n\ndo something about it.\n\nYou can start off by merely talking and\nlooking at the world around you — your uni-\nversity is only a small part of the world.\n\n—MacKay\n\nThe Cadre\n\nThe CADRE is published by and for the University of\nPrince Edward Island Student’s Union.

It is\na loss for the labour and progressive movements\n\nin Canada. CUS was the largest and most influen-\ntial youth organization in Canada.\n\nCUS reflected and to some extent led the in-\ncreasing democratic upsurge of the students in Eng-\nlish- speaking Canada. The dissolution of CUS re-\nflects the weaknesses of a democratic movement\nwhich la,ckgs clear, stable class-conscious leadership.\n\nCUS was attacked from the right because it re-\nflected and attempted to organize the democratic\nupsurge of the students. The big business owned\npress and news media in Canada deliberately, con-\nsistently, sometimes subtly, other times not so\nsubtly and too often successfully, worked to isolate\nleading student organizations, including CUS from\nthe students. Distortion was the main tool of the\nmonopoly press. :\n\nAt the same time and increasingly, CUS was\nweakened by the ultra-“left”’, whose elitism and\npolitical opportunism assisted those who wished to\nisolate CUS. The failure of CUS leaders to place\nconfidence in the students, to lead the students into\naction, their frequent substitution of left phrase-\nology and verbosity for active leadership all objec-\ntively served the right to distor the issues and fin-\nally, to liquidate CUS. ¢\n\nWhile CUS has been liquidated, student prdb—\nlems have not. Indeed, the spectre of unemployed\ngraduates today haunts the campuses as a result\nof the government’s austerity program. A Canad-\nian government which remains wedded to U.S. and\nCanadian big business spells disaster for the future\nof education and the country. A Canadian Union of\nstudents fighting for the students, joining the la-\nbour and anti-monopoly movements of the Canad-\nian people, is a vital need. Progressive students\nshould carry the fight to reorganize and reconstruct\nthe national union of students.\n\nCharles MacFadden, Secretary\nYoung Communist Leagu¢\n    metadata/dublin_core.xml  76b56f9b4388abb9d6a0a3515ad51b0b7198ae6d3bea106075204a8bf43d1a263283e874f097fc262e9c9e5ff8970e4654570caafa05bf7c2943f858b859d65b  cbf44ca69697105942aecd9edbbe7a93c0adea2694248cb68434c0dd0ea130bf6ae55380110d3e83f3aaabcd1aec307dfc3aa4c4139d7d83a087e300ec6a4fb2  bd64edca770e74b0fe7676a44f446f7b324aea9971bfee2f4a1c37ab50b76d78543241ae16eca1130960550d5cb712254d22c45ab7e1d9364b211bd4ff3226f6  99663ca368dcaf93b3e17fe8dc9b79ae3241a7d96ce62856796f285229118927427296a816b44033edbb2bbaa6ea34e7b353013b743f944f247654a46aa408e2  /islandora/object/183/index.html  "

A man stands in a field moan-\ning, “I’'m unhappy. I’m unhappy, I'm so unhappy...”\n\nUp walks a second man, beaming, and hands\nhim something so small the eye misses it.\n\n“Here’s Happiness,” smiles the second man.\n\nThe first man grasps it, then runs off into the\nsunset, shouting. “I'm happy! I'm happy! I’m so\nhappy! I'm...” :\n\nThat’s a film. A short film. It’s titled appro-\npriately enough ‘“Happiness” and in its 55 second\nentirety it’s the briefest of the short-films series,\n“The Kinetic Art,” scheduled to open its three pro-\ngram series Sunday night in the Duffy Amphi-\ntheatre.\n\nThe longest film in the KINET ART series is\none of the most absorbing: Peter Whitehead’s 55-\nminute ‘“Tonight Let’s All Make Love in London”,\nwith its dazzling colour camerawork, it revealing\nportraits of Julie Christie, Michael Caine, Mick\nJagger of the Rolling Stones, and novelist Edna\nO’Brien.\n\nWhy “KINETIC”? Why the Kinetic “ART”?\nFirst of all film-making is an “art” as much as\nmusic, writing, or drama, but what makes it dif-\nferent from painting or still photography, for ex-\nample, is that it is constantly moving — it is\nKINETIC.\n\nEach of the 26 films in the KINETIC ART ser-\nies demonstrates this fascinating element of film,\nwhile at the same time providing hilarious comedy,\nsuperb drama, and all-round great entertainment in\nall styles — cartoons, documentaries, dramatic, ex-\nperimental, and underground.\n\nTake for example “Live in a Tin Can”, by\nBruno Bazzeto — twenty minutes of alternately\nhilarious and satirical counterpoint, pitting life in\nits monotonous and familiar reality against rare\nmoments of escape into fantasy.\n\nOr the black comedy of bizarre combat in an\nantique carnival setting in “Rakvickarna”, which\n~critics describe as ‘“defying description . . . there\nhas never been a film like this before.”\n\nOther challenges to one’s sense of sight and\nsound scheduled for Sunday night’s opening include\n“Phenomena”, by famed film-maker Jordan Belson,\nof San Francisco; “Cruel Diagonals”” — a searingly\ndramatic post war episode; and the hilarious film\njoke “Why Did You Kiss Me Awake”.\n\nChoose the Sunday night performance you wish\n\nto attend — 7:30 or 9:30, but come early if you -\n\nhave not already purchased a ticket. The Kinetic\nArt Committee reports about 60% of the Duffy\nAmphitheatre has already been sold out. If you are\nnot able to obtain a ticket either today or Saturday,\nwe suggest you try and make the 7:30 performance\nin order to obtain a better seat. Series and single\ntickets to the KINETIC ART can still be obtained\nfrom myself or any of the following people: Cathy\nGallant, Denise Levesque, David Aurandt, Kent\nStetson, Carol MacKay, Rowena Hickox, Brian Pol-\nlard, Henry Purdy, Anne Putnam, Donna Andrew,\nor Peter Graham. ,\n\nFellow Student: In reply to your repetition in The\nCadre issue dated Nov. 7, 1969, I am sending a\ncopy to your column for hopeful publication.

Ed\nHilton, Chairman of the athletic department, told them,\naccording to Niles that “you made asses of yourselves”\nduring the student action. He also told them that they\n\nwere fired. W Yy\n\nJohn Keaveny, Student Union President took the\nmatter before the Senate. Although no formal action\nwas taken by the Senate, we have received information\nthat they were offered their jobs back the day after the\nQenate meeting.

Onestudent\ncommented that this is sim-\n\nilar to a 19th century law in\n\nBritain which held that the\npenalty for attempted suicide\nwas death by hanging.\n\nKeaveny felt that if this\ncommittee on faculty was set\nup as a committee of Senate\nthen it should be made up of\nhalf students and half facul-\n\nby\n\nThe suggestion apparently\ngot a very cool reception from\nsenate. President Baker sug-\ngested that if this type of\ncommittee was set up the\nUniversity would lose all of\nits good faculty. .\n\nKeavény commenting on\nBakers statement said “I feel\nthat if a faculty member is\ndoing a good job then he\nwould have nothing to worry\n\nabout from such a commit-\n\ntee ”\n\nHALIFAX — At a confer-\nence at St. Mary’s University\nin Halifax February 6 and 7,\na group of fifty English tea-\nchers and professors from\nacross the Atlantic provinces\ncalled for ‘“the abolition of\nprovincially standardized and\nexternally graded examina-\ntions” in English. This would\ninclude, delegates explained,\nboth the present system of\nmatriculation examinations,\nor departmentals, and any\nother uniform, provincially-\nadministered examination de-\nsigned to rate students ac-\ncording to a provincewide\n\n- standard.\n\nReasons given for the re-\ncommendation include the de-\nlegates’ conviction that Eng-\nlish is a field where such ex-\naminations are both imperfect\nas an evaluation device and\ndetrimental to the teaching of\nEnglish in the high schools.\n\nIt was also contended at\nthe meeting that such exam-\n\n\" inations cannot allow suffic-\n\niently for the wide diversity\nof cultural backgrounds in in-\ndividual provinces, but it was\ndecided not to make this part\nof the official recommenda-\ntions of the meeting.\n\nIt was also recommended\nby the meeting that indivi-\ndual universities should be\nmade responsible for selecting\ntheir own entrance and place-\nment criteria, that the judg-\nment of the classroom teach-\ner in the high school should\nbe “recognized as the decisive\nfactor” in evaluating students\nin English classes, and that\nuniversities should ‘“develop\na range of clearly differen-\ntiated freshman English cour-\nses” to serve the varied needs\nof incoming freshmen.\n\nThe conference, whose of-\nficial title was the “Confer-\nence on Freshman English in\nthe Maritimes,” included de-\nlegates from all four Atlantic\nprovinces, representing uni-\nversities, high schools, and\nprovincial departments of\n\nWar is over (if he\n\nWASHINGTON, DC (CPS)\n—After conferring for sever-\nal hours with top political,\nmilitary, economic and public\nrelations advisers, president\nRichard Nixon today ordered\nthe immediate withdrawal of\nall American troops from\nViet Nam.\n\nIn a startling move of ob-\nscure political brilliance the\npresident said, “It’s not real-\nly our war, anyway.” Presi-\ndential advisers cited grow-\ning political dissention at\nhome and a need to ‘“cement\n\n~ our divided society and allow\n\nus to prepare for the hard\npull ahead.”\n\nThe troops will begin leav-\ning some time next week, as\nsoon as the non-commission-\ned officers clubs can recoup\ntheir losses. The pullout will\namount to some 497,000 mili-\ntary and civilian personnel.\n\nWhen asked if the new C5-A\n\ntransports will be used, a mil-\nitary spokesman explained\nthat the South Vietnamese\ngovernment prohibits aircraft\n\nwhose engines produce over\n140 decibels of sound.\n\nThe South Vietnamese em-\nbassy was closed and the am-\nbassador unavailable for com-\nment.

The\nbiggest social problem in the country\ntoday is loneliness.\n\n“What are you doing tonight?”\n\n“I don’t know, Marty, what are you\ndoing tonight?”\n\nLoneliness is not an individual pro-\nblem—it’s the collective problem of\nmillions of Amerikans, growing out\nof the alienating environment we live\nin. We work in one part of town with:\npeople who are not our friends, and\nwe sleep in another part of town and\ndon’t know our neighbors. We waste\nmuch of our life dying in mobile con-\ncentration camps called freeways or\ncommuter trains.\n\nWhere in the city can we go to\nmake friends? Where can we leap\nout of our individual prisons and en-\njoy each other? The city is full of\nwalls, locked doors; signs saying\n\nDON\"T\n\nIf someone you don’t know, says\nhello, you get uptight: “What’s he\nwant ?”’ It’s taboo to talk to strang-\ners. Everybody’s hustling. The\nstreets are paved with terror, the\ncity a prison for the soul.\n\nThe car, a box, transports lonely\npeople from the box where they sleep\nto the box where they work, and then\nback to the box where they sleep.\nAmerikans relate to each other as\ndrivers of other cars; the only good\n\ndriver is the one who takes another\nroad. People killed on freeways are\ncasualties of a war every bit as fuck-\ned up as Vietnam.\n\nThe streets are for business, not\npeople. You can’t sit in a restaurant\nwithout buying food ; you can read\nmagazines in a store——-you gotta buy,\nhuy, buv—move on, move on. What\nif you’re in the mlddle of the city and\nsuddenly you have to take a shit?\n\nTough shit.\n\nWe are liberating the city, turning\nthe streets into our living rooms. We\nlive, work, eat, play and sleep togeth-\ner with our friends on the streets.\nPower is our ability to stand on a\nstreet corner and do nothing., We are\ncreating youth ghettos in every city,\nluring into the streets everyone who\nis bored at home, school or work. And\neveryone is looking for “something to\ndo.”\n\nFor us empty nockets means libera-\ntion—from draft cards, checkbooks,\ncredit cards, registration papers—we\nare close to our naked bodies.\n\nThe hippie area becomes the first\nmass alternative to the Amerikan ur-\nban prison. Liberated neighborhoods\nare a great threat to capitalist city\nlife. So the forces of death — the\nbusiness community, cops and politi-\n\ncians — conspire to wipe us out. An\n\nentire battery of laws — genocidal\nlaws against the young — makes so-\ncial life in the streets a crime.\n\nIf you don’t hand a cop document-\nary proof of who you are, you can\nbe arrested. To the state empty poc-\nkets means vagrancy.\n\nWatching the world from a street\ncorner is loitering. Hitchhiking is a\ncrime. It’s against the law to pan-\nhandle, to rap to a crowd in the\nstreets, to give out free food in the\nstreets, to stop traffic. Playing a\nharmonica in the streets is illegal in\nVenice, California.\n\nTwo friends of mine were just ar-\nrected for the high political crime\nof pissing in the street. One was put\ninto a mental hospital.\n\n“Underage” kids caught on the\n\n. streets are hauled straight to juven-\n\nile court.\n\n~ And when all else fails, they estab-\nlish a curfew, a Nazi law designed to\nprevent us from getting together.\n\nThese laws are designed to strike\nfear in the youth community. Al-\nthough they exist on the books every-\nwhere, they are enforced only in the\nghetto. Cops patrol the hippie areas\nthe way they patrol black communi-\nties, the way Amerikan soldiers pat-\nrol Vietnamese villages. Everyone is\na likely enemy.\n\nBut the main strategy for destroy-\ning the free spirit is business. “Psy-\nchedelic” stores try to steal the cul-\nture by selling fake arti-facts to an\nemotion-starved Outside World. Cam-\neratoting Amerikan tourists come\nthrough in buses and on foot, snap-\nping pictures, laughing, squealing,\npointing at us.\n\nThe streets turn into a hustle, a\nbusiness section.\nwhom to trust. Burn artists and un-\ndercover cops flood the place, making\nit unsafe to buy or sell dope on the\nstreet.\n\nWe become an 1s1and ina ca,pltajlst\nsea, attacked and infiltrated from\ninside and outside. e death culture\ntries to destroy our life force and re-\nstructure the youth ghetto in its own\n\nWe never know\n\nFEBRUARY 20, 1970\n\nimage. We lack space in oﬁr own\ncommunity — to breathe; conspire,\ncelebrate, grow.\n\nIt is a war for land. Our survival\ndepends on our ability to drive out\nthe psychedelic exploiters, the invad-\ning pigs and the politicians, and cre-\nate youth communities where drop-\n?ut from middle-clace Amerika can\nive.\n\nOur goal is to create fires, black-\nouts, subway stoppages, strikes and\nsnowstorms because only in crisis\n\ndoes liberation come to a city. People\n\nmeet their neighbors for the first\ntime while watching their apartment\nbuildings burn down. When the sub-\nway rumbles along, everyone acts as\n\nif no one else is aboard. As soon as\n\nthere’s a breakdown, people start\n\ntalking to strangers.\n\nan amusement park\nCrisis brings hberatmn to a mty\nThe revolution declares all land\n\n- titles null and void. We are urban\n\nand rural liberators, seizing land for\nthe people. No more “I own it!” Peo-\nple who believe they can own natural\nresources, industries or land are\nreally candidates for mental mstltu-\ntions.\n\nWe will bring the war to the sub—\nurbs. The middle class creates sub-\n\nurbs as a sanctuary from the fire of\n\nthe city. Children raised in the sub-\nurbs are treated as mentally and phy-\nsmally retarded. If we are not safe\nin our communities, why should cor-\nporate executives be safe in theirs?\n\nWe'll get our own tourist buses,\nsteal cameras and ride through the\nsuburbs squealing, laughing, snap-\nping and pointing fingers. :\n\nIn a revolution there are no sanc-\ntuaries.\n\nThis is an excerpt from a forthcoming book by Jerry\nRubin called “Do it!” It wll be released by Simon and\nSchuster later this month.

Reasons for re-\nsigning were variously given as: an inability to keep\nKeaveny from running the meetings; the so-called\ndamage and mess left by students in the government\nbuilding (untrue) ; and his feeling that he lost his\nimpartiality by inviting students over a microphone\nto come to a meeting.\n* After Council defeated a motion to accept his\n\"/ resignation, he agreed to stick out his term. But\nLeo has stayed out — leaving Jerry Brimicombe\n\n.with the job at a late date.\n\nThe brief lesbian mouth-to-mammary scene in\n~ “The Killing of Sister George” was snipped out by\nthe censor (who lives in New Brunswick by the\n\nway). I guess the reasoning was that mere mortals\ncouldn’t take such stimulation.\n\nI can imagine what would happen if they brought\nin “I Am Curious (Yellow)”. The censor would\nprobably have a field day with the scissors and\nwhat you would see would take about 5 minutes to\nrun. \\ \\\n| Apart from which, you may remember that the\nAlberta censor is presently up on a morals charge.\nSeems there was this 14 year old “chick”....\n\n~ Saturday, February 21 is the date for the hear-\nings in Charlottetown of the Ledain Commission on\nthe Non-Medical Use of Drugs.

Appar-\nently Lynch felt that it would not look very good\nfor the Student Union if the External Vice-President\n\n had curtainless windows. : ~\n\n'NOTHING LIKE HINDSIGHT\n\n‘ “It i-s not always easy to evaluate a situation,\nespecially when it differs radically from what we\nhave come to consider the norm.\n\nThe thought is inspired by the obvious accord\nprevailing at the University of P.E.I. between the\nstudent body and the administration. No battles are\nbeing fought on issues weighty or otherwise, no\nthreats of boycott are heard, no lockouts or sitins;\n\n“in fact such an aura of peacefulness hangs over the\ninstitution that it draws attention by comparison\nto other colleges elsewhere.\n\nCrossword Puzzle\n\nAcross : Down\n\nWe understand students themselves can find\nlittle of which to complain as we have been told they\n\n‘have no compulsory courses, no curfew hours — and\n\ngood food. In fact the things we have heard would\nmake any confirmed radical squirm for the very lack\nof material with which to start a campus revolution.\nIf any such there be in our midst they must be de-\nveloping ulcers from sheer frustration.\n\nWhat caused this change in so short a space of\ntime? It seems only a few weeks since we watched\nplacard-carrying students roaming over the Mal-\npeque campus, setting up “strike” headquarters and\ncutting all classes, and such a short time ago those\nfrom the Downtown campus were marching in force\n\n- on the Legislature. )\n\nYet today quiet reigns over both to the extent\nof recalling the poetic lines “here shall ye see no\nenemy but winter and rough weather.”\n\nPerhaps a mere taxpayer should not ask what\nhappened, just accept the situation thankfully and\nbe grateful the riots and rebellions of other colleges\nfind no welcome in our town.”\n\n—_editorial “Evolution of Peace” |\n\n1.

Common law crimes are of-\nten classified as “treason”, “felonies”, and “mis-\ndemeanors”. Treason meant conspiracy with the\nking’s enemy, and the “traitor’s” property was\nconfiscated by the King. Felonies were grave crimes\nagainst the feudal system and the “felon’s” pro-\nperty was forfeited to his feudal lord. Misdemean-\nors are all the minor crimes developed within the\ncapitalist nation state.\n\nUnder early common law the local nobles and\nland owners rendered legal decisions. Often other\nforms of trial were used, for example “trial by\ncombat”, by “ordeal” (e.g. hot iron or boiling\nwater.)\n\nWhile a few protections against this feudal law\nsystem were won (habeas corpus) as industrial\ncapitalism developed; for Canada, without even a\nrevolutionary history providing for lberal rights,\nit is accurate to speak of our legal system as a mu-\ntation of conservative laws inherited from the feudal\npast and laws developed by a capitalist nation state.\nThe only progressive thing about our courts is the\narchitecture.\n\nMagistrates, who sit over most court cases in\nCanada, are political appontees. They do not even\nneed legal training, which actually might make them\nmore humanist. Feudal lords no longer sit over\ntheir serfs, but the form of today’s courts has a\nreal similarity with the past. The dispossessed, min-\norities, lower classes and political prisoners fill the\njails and penetentiaries since the distribution of\nwealth and power in the society safeguards others.\n\nWhen the courts are studied historically and\nsociologeally, the apologists for them are left with\nonly some reified “theory” of criminality (which\nupon analysis turns out to be racist or elitist) to\njustify the dire consequences for those who are pun-\nished.\n\nWhen the condtions that determine who is pun-\nished are understood, the modern trial proves to\n\nhave little more to do with justice and truth than\nthe older trial by ordeal. We simply have more so-\nphisticated forms of irrationality in our courts today_\n\nLegitimizes oppression\n\nNow, what of the criminal code (C.C.) in Canada?\nIt is the “body of law” that in its present or amend-\ned form will legitimize the political use of police\nagainst the new reform movement.\n\nConsistent with the conservative nature of our\ncourts, and the lack of effective civil liberty protec-\ntions, is the astonishing repressiveness of parts of\nthe C.C.\n\nThe political laws which exist as a threat or\nwhich can be applied harshly show the ‘“tautology\nof authority” in the capitalist nation state in which\nwe live. As long as people act within the authority\nsystem, and accept its rhetoric uncritically, they\n\nare said to be “free.” As long as they use the so-\n\ncalled “proper channels” (which change over time\nto the advantage of elites), they have “rights.”\nWhen people begin to question, and, more import-\nant, to evaluate the conditions that underlie author-\nity and the consequences of the use of that authority\n(when they become intelligent, that is), laws exist\nto oppress them.\n\nIt is a self-perpetuating system; conservative\nand latently reactionary by its very structure. It is\nnot democratic, except in rhetoric, since it does not\nensure that people have real controls over the chang-\ning conditions that affect them.\n\n' The police are often the instruments of political\noppression, though it is a mistake to believe (as\nmany seem to) that it is the “mentality of the cops”\nper se that leads to such oppression. It is crucial to\nunderstand the ideology and controls that ensure\nthat police are reliable for this task. As bureaucrats\nin a corporation must actually believe, absolutely, in\nwhat they do, to do it efficiently, so too police must\nalso possess totally uncritical beliefs. “Law and or-\nder” must be reified, much as the idea of “God”’\nhas been in past periods.\n\nWe can get an indication of police ideology by\nstudying a 273 page “book” that RCMP personnel\npossess. It is sort of a handbook. What past RCMP\nCommissioner Wood ecalled “this series of lectures”\n(the authors are unidentified, though several peo-\nple, including Diefenbaker are credited with assis-\ntance) in the introduction can give us the needed\ninsight into the police beliefs that ensure that the\ntautology of authority operates when reform move-\nments begin to show success.\n\nI will concentrate on a sampling of statements to\nshow the police beliefe that complement the use of\npolice for political oppression. '\n\n“Freedom” is of course the call word. Our so-\nciety does everything—fought “two terrible wars”,\nentered Korea and joined NATO—“to guard against\n\nBREAD AND WATER s\n1S THE BREAD AND BUTTER\n\nOF A ‘LAW-AND-ORDER’ ELITE,\n\nthe ever growing danger of a tyranny such as the\nworld has never known.” What the tyranny is is not\nclear, but it is better propaganda if left unintellig-\nible at this stage in the “book.”\n\nThe “forward” clearly established that ‘“we” are\nthe good guys. It also establishes the use of an irra-\ntional language about crime,\n\n“Crime is contagious and infectious. Contact\nwith criminals, the taint of criminal atmos-\nphere, makes more criminals; too often the\nnew recruit to the ranks of the evildoers is\ninvolved before he is aware and offends be-\nfore he knows that he is erring; then the\ndownward path is easy.”\n\nWorded in a more rational way with some argu-\nment involved, this statement could suggest that\ncriminal socialization and recidivism result from\npenal subcultures, which is the case; but, since the\nbook includes a large discussion of political laws,\nthis irrational statement serves as a basis for the\n“conspiracy theory” that is central to police ideol-\nogy. This conpiracy theory, which pervades the\nmedia and government as well as the police, goes\nlike this:\n\nContact with subversives is what leads to\nreform movements. Since this society is pro-\ngressing there is no need for such movements.\nPeople have no intelligence by which to make\nsense of their own experience, and act to\nchange conditions. Those in authority know\nwhat is best for the people.\n\nCould the authoritarian setup of police forces\nthemselves lead many policemen to protect their\nown dependency on rigid authority and leadership\ninto a conspiracy theory of social movements?\n\nTheir own forced dependency certainly comple-\nments their unquestioning belief in conspiracies.\nArresting “the leaders” is thus justified as being\nboth in the interests of “public order” and “the\ncommon good.” It is even good for the people led\nastray. It is indeed an insular self-fulfilling ideo-\n\nlogy.\n\nPolice as judges\n\nThe “book” is built on rhetoric, not on historical\nevidence. It opens with i\n\n‘““Canadian democracy is real and vibrant,\npulsating with the life-blood of a young na-\n\ntion, and has its roots in the rich heritage of\n\nthe post. But our democratic way of life is\nthreatened, both by active forces within and\nfrom outside, and by an all-too-often passive\nstate within. Have we the will to survive, both\nas a nation and as a democracy?”\n\nAnd of course, “law and order” is emphasized\nas the backbone of Canadian democracy; ‘‘where\nthe law-enforcement agencies are the friends of all\nlaw-abiding citizens.” And, of course, the RCMP\nknows the true meaning of “law” and of “order”:\n\n“Qur ideas, which time and experience have\nproved to be generally sound....” i\n\nHere is the first example of how the police, con-\ntrary to all rhetoric about all citizens being equal be-\nfore the law, are trained to see themselves as judges.\nThe Court judge is quite secondary to the judge-\nments made by the police when they interpret be-\nhavior as criminal or not.\n\nDemocratic and totalitarian societies are later\n\ndistinguished as follows:\n\n' “In Canada the stafe is the servant of the\nindividual; in other forms of government the\n_individual is the servant of the state.”\n\nThe speaker of the House of _Commons; from\n\nwhom this is quoted, i\ndialectics of absolute\nsive categories always\nstudy.

It rationalizes his work and gives\na meaning to his life.\n\nSince many police recruits are from the lower\n\nclasses, they can compensate for their frustrated\nstatus needs, and reconcile the dissonance between\n\n. the free-enterprise rhetoric and their actual lack of\n\nopportunity by becoming such a public servant.\n\nThey see themselves as having status, and suc-\ncess. The are also self-sacrificing, even a bit\nmartyred for others.\n\nLook at the following quotes taken from the\nselection on the policeman in the RCMP book:\n\n® To be a policeman “requires skill, intelli-\ngence, forebearance and compassion to live\none’s own life within the law, yet it requires\nmuch more than these to apply that law...to\nthe acts of others.\n\nOnce again we see the simple equation of com-\nformity and good. The policeman must just be that\nmuch better than others. Such a Superman self im-\nage can justify almost anything—sadism and bru-\ntality included. Giving the police such a view of\n\n“intelligence” makes the ‘“law-breaker” almost\nsub-human. !\n@® The Policeman needs “...comprehension\n\nof democratic philosephy .. intelligence .. (to)\nstudy, understand and interpret laws...”\n\nThe “philosopher cop”\n\nWhat occurs to me is the image of a “Philoso-\npher-Cop” (not unlike Plato’s Philosopher King),\nviewing society and other humans in a detached\nand objective way; enforcing laws according to their\n“True” interpretation. ;\n\nAgain words that suggest “being smart” have\nimmense power for those not upwardly mobile, yet\nwho possess all the values of such mobility.\n\n@® The policeman needs “..strength of char-\nacter. . .(he must) resist the many human im-\npulses excusable in the private citizen but dis-\nastrous to the policeman, requires not only\nself-control but an understanding of the\nshort-comings of others.”\n\nHere is the self-sacrificing, all-understanding po-\nliceman. A combination of paternalism, moralism\nand authoritarianism is nurtured both to ensure\nthat the recruit will not rebel against his restric-\ntive job and will impose the laws on others unques-\ntioningly. People with a history of abuse and neg-\nlect often fit well into this submissive-authoritarian\nrole. ;\n\n@ The policeman needs “..understanding. ..\ntolerance. . .physical excellence. . .bravery and\nheroism. . .courage...”\n\nThe policeman is getting closer and closer to the\nmale stereotype that has dominated the society,\nand which fits so nicely the needs of a militaristic\n\nand regimented system |\n\n@ His is “..The true desire to serve the pub-\n¢ lic—A belief in the worthiness of mankind—\n\na desire for variety and adventure and the\n\nspiritual need for self-sacrifice for the bene-\n. fit of other people.”\n\nThe highest good, doing for others. It is amaz-\ning how a self-sacrificing self image, for one iden-\ntifying so totally with authority, making only\npseudo-choices (within the law), not moral choices\nabout the effects of what he does for other people,\ncan maintain such a self view. The double-talk that\noperates for police about “freedom and order” also\nworks at another level, the very center of person-\n\nality.\n\nCdntradictory theory '\n\nWith possessive individualism and authoritarian-\nmoralism “established” the “book” goes on to dis-\n\ncuss the causes and prevention of, and punishment\nfor crime.\n\n' Criminology is used in a reified, anti-intellectual\nmanner. “Police forces practice crime prevention”,\nand the raising of “young citizens”, not “young\ncriminals” also helps. Deterrence and rehabilitation\n(“represson” anid “repressive tolerance”) are mixed\ninto a self contradictory theory of punishment.\n\nNext we get a 40-page summary of treason, sedi-\ntion, communism, fascism, and national socialism.\nIt has the same assumptions of many university\ncourses taught by those intimidated by McCarthy-\nism, though the blatant statement of them would\nnever succeed in passing as value-free social science,\neven to the most indoctrinated students. Order is\nagain the main emphasis. Order and civilized (ver-\nsus primitive) societies are even equated.\n\nAnd the inevitable contradiction within mono-\npoly capitalsm is exposed. The “State”, not the\n“Individual” now becomes important per se.; Sedi-\ntion helps to preserve “The tranquility of the state.”\n\nThe political oppression of the police is thus “jus-\ntified” not by some quasi-humansm but by a\npseudo-totalitarianism. Humanist rhetoric might\neven subvert the RCMP if it was articulated clearly.\n\nMention is made of the conviction of R. B. Rus-\nsell, a leader of the Winnipeg strike (1919) for\nsedition:\n\n“While there was no evidence produced at his\ntrial to show that Russell was a Communist...\nstill his speeches showed that he believed and\nadvocated the principles of revolution adopted\nby the Communists.”\n\nHere is an example of how policy ideology re-\n\nduces specific to its own metaphysics. And this is\n\naided by the same old double-talk: “no evidence. ..\nthat he was a Communist. . .still his speeches show-\ned that he believed and advocated the principles\nadopted by the Communists”.\n\nAccording to the “book” sedition protects socie-\nties from “outside influences. ..suppressing all ac-\ntivites” which would lead to “civil war and anar-\nchy.” “Every serious minded citizen” should assist\nin “erradicating this menace to his way of life, his\nhome, his freedom of thought and his country.”\n\nThe wording almost incites the true believer in\nthe conspiracy theory to go out and kill himself a\ncommie for the good of mankind. It never ceases\nto shock me how words can be conditioned to such\nirrationality, with no valid meanings whatsoever.\n\nAfter this, communism and fascism are both de-\nfined as totalitarian, and arguing from general,\ntautological principles, to specifics about history\nthe simplistic conspiracy theory is again perpetu-\nated. Any possible understanding of the history of\nEurope since the turn of the century is destréyed.\n“Fellow travellers” are implicated in the plot, and\nagain the policeman becomes the true protector of\npeace, law and order. i\n\nThen there is the task of controlling riots. Doing\nhis duty of breaking strikes, protest demonstrations\nor whatever, “criticisms, and there will always be\nsome, will be levelled at him. He must be big enough\nto accept these without faltering.”\n\nHe can do no wrong, for he is carrying out the\n“law.” And, anyway, he is a better human than the\n“rioters.” He also has great “degrees of freedom”\nin his approach, and is confident and protected by\nhis modern equipment. The law gives him immense\nprotections against “rioters”, and he is again told\nthat it is “the actions of a few” that endanger the\nrights of the many.\n\nThe “book” concludes on the same note it began,\nand with the same irrational language about\n“crime”.\n\n“The field of crime is not static, and no agency\nengaged in combating this insidious and con-\ntagious disease can afford to be static. In\n\nthese days the impact of crime upon society |\n\nand subversive efforts to deprive us of our\nhard-won freedoms and democratic principles\nis of importance to us all.”\n\nI\n\nCivil disobedience.\n\n‘I know of no instance where those who identify\nso totally with conservative authority have aided in\nthe ongoing struggle to put social institutions in the\n\ncontrol of people.\n\nThough the RCMP book emphasizes the vote as\nbasic to democracy, police ideologists handily forgot\nthat it took forms of civil disobedience to win the\nfranchise for the working people.\n\nCIVIL DISOBEDIENCE AND REFORM\nSTRATEGY\n\nThe liberal rhetoric that cloaks the authoritarian-\nism of this society appears to have immense power\n\nover the population, including the student reform-\ners themselves.\n\nUnderneath their own radicalism there seems to\nbe a naive belief in the ability of this society to pro-\ngress. Often what appears as “miltancy” also turns\nout to be naive.\n\nIt is not that their experience isn’t radicalizing\nthem, for it is. It is their lack of understanding of\nthe latent power of the state, that keeps them naive.\n\nWhat I suggest may serve to undercut some of\nthis naivete and help build a historical foundation\non which to build a viable militancy in the student\nmovement. My conclusions, interestingly, turn out\nto be much the same as those made by Thoreau a\n\nhundred years ago. Here is what he wrote about\nlaws:\n\n“I think that we should be men first, and subjects\nafterword. It is not desirable to cultivate a respect\nfor the law, so much as the right. . .Law never made\nmen a whit more just; and, by means of their res-\npect for it, even the well-disposed are daily made\nthe agents of injustice.\n\n“A common and natural result of an undue res-\npect for law is that you see a file of soldiers. . .\nmarching in admirable order over hill anl dale to the\nwars, against their wills, ay, against their common\nsense and conscience...The mass of men serve the\n\nstate thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with\ntheir bodies.\n\n“They are the standing army, and the militia,\njailers. constables, etc...others—as most legislatures,\npoliticians, lawyers, ministers, and officeholders —\nserve the state chiefly with their heads; and as they\n\nrarely make any moral distinctions, they are as\n\nlikely to serve the Devil, without intending it, as\nGod...”\n\nI would add “academics” to the list of those who\nnow serve the state chiefly with their heads. And I\nwould suggest that the power of the state is far\ngreater in monopoly capitalism, and far more op-\npressive, than when Thoreau lived. I question the\nstrategic worth of civil disobedience in the face of\nthis system which links laws, police ideology and\nelite power in such a fashion that oppression of re-\nform movements is so integrated.\n\nWhere a system is so integrated that rhetoric re-\nmains credible to those conforming; and oppression\nof reformers can be “legalized” in the eyes of those\nunaffected, long-range planning for a thorough so-\ncial revolution seems the only just thing to do.\n\nJim Harding, formerly a graduate student at Simon\nFraser university in British Columbia was a teach-\ning assistant at the University of Saskatchewan un-\ntil last fall when his contract was not renewed.\n\nCanada’s criminal code gives law officers and\n‘, court officials the right to oppress minorities\nand stifle reform movements.\n\n    metadata/dublin_core.xml  fd8680e605afb8ee1169f0b6e2cdbd977f977713c9a6dbe46487aa21c8795c86078bd780eb4f853390f207a94221636f30dc9feca8c71d8232fb88ec5a449e74  44bb86c9c536e0a9d346a77e19376d28a5647f29d64d1da46bf6f8055ed0642e091501e6a7203c03bf21c6643dc4f494e7b8eb1c2a00709e608ebec80ffe3a2c  2f38dd1a967241e656831e3b4d6799d618cf024113e1899d8a9874b13753232c911aae6a55fb88a573e3790746fbe59614a2085589058b9d1c8323cdd5184871  4f6479f835ee420724828b12ec8975ad7baeca9b0eb1c517a6f4a6340e16e51a13bc4b99951a6cd7bc0fa690b6f4b2cb2ae0c032f46c76f6b36c92514b805e10  /islandora/object/191/index.html  "

E. 1.\n\nFEBRUARY 20, 1970\n\nA THREE-RING CIRCUS\nOF THE MIND\n\nWhen Juel Cook, the last remaining Black Pan-\nther field worker was here, he did something that\nto my knowledge hasn’t been done before at UPEL\nHe laid a rap on us.\n\nAs is usual with anyone who speaks to the stud-\nent body with passionate conviction, he was very\nwell applauded. And as is usual with anyone who\nwanted more response than the collision of one hand\nwith the other, he didn’t get it.\n\nThe role he was hoping that the 400 or so peo-\nple in Duffy would fulfill would be to give a little\nmoney to what Rocky Jones called “The brothers\non the front lines.” Out of that ecrowd they got\nabout $25.00.\n\nThey’re trying to raise $6 million for bail. That\nwouldn’t bail a guy out of city jail for jaywalking.\n\nThe reasons for the abrupt split between ap-\nplause and response are interesting:\n\nOne was surely the fact that few if any students\ncome from a cultural background of violence, hat-\nred and oppression, and couldn’t really get on the\nman’s wavelength. Not that you have to be a poor\nblack from Oakland or Watts to understand the rea-\nson for the Panthers emergence on the American\nscene. For example, magazines like Ramparts and\nthe Guardian, (The Guardian — from New York),\nand books like The Autobiography of Malcolm X,\nGene Marine’s The Black Panthers, and the works\nof Franz Fanon and Eldridge Cleaver give some\nbackground to black ghetto experience.\n\nThe inability of a majority of middle-class\nwhites to believe that policemen can kill people for\nlittle or no reason, and then escape prosecution be-\ncause of the machinery of “justice’” is definately a\nstumbling block to comprehension.\n\nA closer to home example of typical police men-\ntality is found in the survey taken in Quebec where\nthe police were found to dislike “hippies” more than\nthey dislike criminals. And it is indisputable that\nmany white cops have a similar if more violent pre-\njudice to blacks.\n\nCertainly no one pretends that black people are\nnever violent, never ‘let their rhetoric get carried\naway with itself—but they have been oppressed on\n\nhe continent and especially in the United States of\nerican for hundreds of years. They are a colonial\npeople of the run-away monster USA.\n\nThere were the usual bright-eyed idealists who\nquestioned Cooks philosophy of violence, who ac-\nused the Panthers of racism even though Cook tried\no emphasize that “it is a class struggle nqt a race\nstruggle.”” Many expounded the old bullshit SNCC\npassive resistance theory.\n\nOf course the fact that the University commun-\nty reduces every struggle big or little to an intel-\nlectual abstraction in which the catch phrases and\nsuperficial ‘appearances are bandied about without\nany assimilation of their gpirit and motives, dooms\nany effort before it starts.\n\nThe large crowd was obviously looking to be\nsantertained. Juel would have been a bigger hit if\nhe had come with a black beret, a submachine gun\nand a bandolier of bullets.\n\n—Hornby\n\nThe Cadre\npditor/buffoon: jim hornby\n\no 1 menial: dennis mackay\nailings/profundty: martin kenny, garybear\nren assistance: the mysterious layouter\nolumns/waste: megaughey, karl m, agamemnon id\nock tock: dave mitchell :\neporters: very funny\nbhotos: hornby and mackay\nyping: various token women\newd behavior: captain bearheart\nndecent exposure: the bear party\nnspiration: the pusherman\n\nartin deserted the forte for new york where he will prae-\nice his joe buck routine: dennis is ratso from afar( the best\nwva to take him we find) while in the office staffers come\nind go talking of michelangelo (i made that up: tgley dont\neally) the secret southport agent snuck in a few nights for\nLuickies. wendy and gail typed one night whilst terry was\nuthlessly efficient. captain bearheart walked qroun_d with\nts fly down to the delight of mcgaughey who just idolizes\nsuch cheap hypes. well thats showbiz fokes. keaveny was\nhilked for about $6 by crafty hornby—better known as grafty\n\\rotection money for the darling of the press. you do_get\nather tired of typing up your own crap _for the foqrth night\nn a row. next week we absolutely positively promise a new\n reate canadian novel, gross cartoons and (below all) the\n»ar manifesto. cross our bearheart and hope to die!\n\n“. ..and did you voluntarily accept a free, hot meal from\nknown Black Panthers at nine a.m., February nine, nineteen\n\nhun’ert an’ seventy ?”\n\nHdo e\n\nThere are two things which bother me about\nthe Sir George Williams Computer affair which\nwere pointed out by the speakers from Sir George\nwho visited the Campus recently. They were never\nmentioned in the local press nor national news me-\ndia, yet they are both very important. The first\none is the make up of the jury by which the students\nare to be tried. The second one is the refusal of\neither the provincial or the federal government to\nallow a full scale government investigation into the\nmatter.\n\nIt is a basic principle of Anglo-saxon justice\n\nthat a man shall be tried by his peers. Yet of the\ncandidates for jurymen in the trial not one of the\ncandidates were black. Surely there are enough\nblack people in Montreal to allow for having some\nof them on the jury. Also the jury in general were\n\nmiddle aged. Can it be said that these students are\n\ngoing to get a fair trial.\n\nIt is also interesting to note that the average\nbail for black students was $4,000 and for the white\nstudents only $1,5007 |\n\nBecause of the conflicting statements made by\nthe police and members of the Sir George Williams\nadministration it is quite clear that the fact have\n\nnot all been brought out. While the black students\n\nare willing to accept their responsibility for certain\nevents they have persistently called for a full scale\ninvestigation of the matter but have been refused\nthis by both the federal and provincial government.\nWhy ? I personally believe that it is not merely the\nblack students who are on trial here but Canadian\nsociety which is being charged with blatant racism.\nCanada is on trial also, and University and govern-\nment officials want the whole thing swept under\nthe rug as quickly as possible. And at what cost is\n“justice” passed on 42 black students. :\n\nFebruary 26 is a national day of solidarity with\nthe Sir George students. I would urge that the mat-\nter be discussed by council and if it seess fit, some\nform of action should be taken to show support for\nthe demands being made by the Black students at\nSir George. ‘\n\nA telegram of support — requesting an inves-\ntigation — seems to be in order. |\n\npon.”\n\nDown in black & white\n\nReply and fugue\n\nI do not like the editorial we reprinted for\nCarolyn Dgffy on page 7. The reasons she quotes\nme as hav1qg given were somewhat rhetorical, al-\nthough I think that they can be quite easily justi-\nfied — except for “fascist,” which was ‘probably in\nreference to some things I have heard Miss Clancy\n(the outhor of the piece) say, and as such are not\ngermane to this discussion.\n\nFirstly, I felt that it was naive in its conception\nof the womens liberation movement. The movement,\nas } see it, consists of women redefining their role\nin society as something other than another instru-\nmen’t of man’s gratification — a sexual object for\nman’s use.\n\n_The image of a woman going to university\nmainly to catch a husband, or to get a job to sup-\n\n- port her until she can; of women being nurses but\n\nnot doqtors, teachers but not principals, etec. This\nimage is largely the responsibility of women, and\nthe women’s liberation movement is trying to change\n\n_it. These people are not a bunch of slightly buteh,\n\nrepressed potential old maid stereotypes, who have\nno sex appeal and are bitter about it: they merely\nwant to define themselves as equal to men, instead\nof having equality a rare and (literally) remarkable\noccurrence.\n\nJaniel Jolley, the SFU protest candidate in the\nWaterloo Lutheran Winter Carnival Queen pageant,\nis an example of the rebellion against the Playboy-\nimage of women as cattle whose worth is judged by\nexternals.\n\nAs far as snobbish goes, I think the reference\nto people being unwashed and “exuding a peculiar\nodor” needs no amplification.\n\nSmugness is indicated in Miss Clancy’s totally\nunfounded assumption that she presents a threat to\nthe radical movement and would thus be “the first\nto face the firing squad.” The statement that “We\nbourgeoisie pigs are safe as long as (the radical\nmovement’s) growth is numerical and not intellec\ntual” also strikes me as smug. :\n\nHer opinion that radicals who call themselves\nMarxists don’t really know what Marx was writing\nabout, strikes me very funny, coming, as it does,\nfrom one who has told me that she is a “Trudeau\nphile”. Her own knowledge of Marx or anything\nradical has never struck me as being anything out\nof the ordinary — which is to say, practically noth-\ning. This opinion is certainly uninformed.\n\nI call the article intellectually dishonest because\nit is so convinced of its righteousness, when it dis-\nplays a frighteningly superficial view of the situa-\ntion it is purporting to describe. . ‘\n\nAs I have indicated, I don’t feel that the ar-\nticle is very important. What is important is that\nMiss Duffy took the time to express her views. The\nimportance of the view one expresses is, at this early\nstage in the development of UPEI, secondary to the\nfact of the expression itself.\n\nDialogue is surely the thing we need most if we\nare ever going to develop.\n\nCPUNCIL QUOTE OF THE WEEK\nKeaveny: “What’s the motion ?”’\nMacKay (acting chairman): “Well...\nEveryone knows what the motion is.”\n\nBlack Panther\ncarryin’ what he imagines could be a concealed lethal wea-\n\n    metadata/dublin_core.xml  6f3d896862624a3eb24de5cdbde56d3b617cd7fd9cc96e632076e56f7bf73c967922d50c1c3cc4819431e9c5b81f43b2ad6b8b05ada19404b0141e26dd3ee8da  fdcedc2359e489129758891bc3322957991c005a8a46cece295da2da43146d26c91905958eb2aa9d4b70b7fc5d398d161c46ba2d689ee9a6ec87d3ebff759b57  44d5b062e87b4dda8683a6b4b03496524162314a0b13a61c23332e78d1db7ae6587ed10aa8bd2a873c0de30a33ab64372b5d9b1b81932c8cba232487e29a53da  409dbffb8cc7fb6db90d3358a51bac46c101e097e38b43b277b386df98666179066a66d379d1050ffad1fb83aad38c7eb815164da8446357698739dfa85fcd4a  /islandora/object/192/index.html  "

St. Vincent\nUniversity at Rockingham, N.S. Miss Duffy’s com-\nment appears below the article written as an editor-\nial for the January 24th issue of the Picaro. The\nauthor Mary Clancy is Culture Editor of the paper.\n(For Editor’s response, see page 6.) :\n\n'© WHISTLE ME THAT AGAIN\n‘ by Mary Clancy\n\nStudent Radicalism is the in thing. If you\naren’t radical now you’d better jump on the band\nwagon before it’s too late. However, there are cer-\ntain rules to follow for all devotees of the radical\nline. First: All student radicals must have a good\ncommand of the jargon of their particular philoso-\nphy ; it is not necessary to understand the philoso-\nphy just insert the words into your vocabulary and\nuse at all times. Second: to be a good radical you\nmust constantly crap on the government of your\ncountry for small imperfections. It is not safe to\n_ criticize the big imperfections because to do this one\n\nmust have some knowledge of what one is talking\nabout. ! gl 8\n\n-~ Although it is not a definite rule most radicals\n\nof this ilk are expected to be unwashed and exude\n\na peculiar odour. It’s so colorful and shows that you\ncan’t be influenced by the bourbeoisie habits of our\ncorrupt system.\n\nThe favoured line of most radicals today is the\nMarxist brand of socialism. At least that’s what\nthey claim. Marx might have difficulty recognizing\nhis words in the mouths of these reformers, but af-\nter all, when one is so concerned with saving the\nworld from the bourgeoisie mentality one hasn’t\ntime to read the unexpurgated editions of the Mas-\nter.\n\n'Cané,da in the eyes of these reformers is in a\nterrible mess. We are run by the Imperialistic war\nmongering capitalist pigs (capitalist pigs are dif-\n\nferent from us run of the mill fascist pigs because\nthey already have the money and we are still trying\nto get it). Our country is totally dominated by the\nAmerican I.W.C.P. However this situation will be\n\nremedied when the revolution comes and all dissen--\n\nters are liquidated.\n\nYou are probably wondering how soon this\n- glorious event is going to take place. Well it’ hasn’t\nquite been decided yet. Actually it hasn’t gone be-\nyond the talk stage yet and at the rate things are\ngoing it never will. You see the most important re-\nquirement for a redical is tolerance. Not in the\nsense of putting up with the beliefs of others but\n_rather in the ability to sit around in smoke filled\nrooms for months even years and talk, talk, talk\nabout all the marvelous things you’re going to do\nI you ever get aroun dto it.\n\nRadicalism can really flourish in thisi dreadful\ncountry of ours because we do still maintain a sem-\nblance of free speech. As far as I could see no one\nhas yet been carried off for verbally assaulting the\n\n. government. No one is arrested for singing Maoist\nsongs or spouting communist propaganda. This is\nfine for the present but when the reformers take\nover all this shillly shallying will cease. After all\nyou can’t keep things in order if people disagree\n\nwith you. Thus when the glorious revolution comes’\n\nall petty bourgeiosie will be dealt with severely. I\nhave no doubt that such people as I will be the first\nto face the firing squad.\n\nI don’t think it’s necessary to get worried im-\nmediately. The rate of progression is so slow that\nby the time they take over it should be 2020. Those\nof us in our twenties now will be in our seventies\nthen and probably willing to be shot.\n\nThe total picture of the student brand of radic-\nalism includes women’s liberation too. This does\nnot, as you might have thought, include lobbying\nfor better jobs, higher wages, and the like. Rather\nit covers such relevant actions as the right of fe-\nmales to be voluble in words of four letters. It also\n\n takes in planning attacks on the editor of McLean’s\n\n“malilstrom\n\nPantherettes strike\nDear Sir: i ‘\n\nI would like to protest an episode of brutality\nwhich occurred on the UPEI campus on Friday,\nFebruary 6th, 1970. The nursing students of the\nPrince Edward Island School of Nursing were invit-\ned to participate in the Powder Puff hockey game.\n\nBut what we did participate in was guerilla\nwarfare. We were under the impression that we\nwould be playing good clean hockey. The girls from\nthe UPEI team appeared more interested in seeing\nmany many bones they could break. Perhaps they\nheard that the nursing students are in the process.\nof taking a First Aid course and the UPEI team\n\nwere interested in giving them some practical ex- :\n\nperience.\n\nI wouldn’t think that the girls on the UPEI\n\nteam are accus»igomed to using “powder puffs”! Hel-\n- mets, mouth pieces, and shin pads are more along\ntheir line. ‘ s ' j g\n\nThere were a few hockey players on the UPEI\nteam who should be called up by the Boston Bruins\n\nto strengthen their fighting force.

Due to the tremendous support it re-\nreceived at the box office an unscheduled second perfor-\nmance was presented immediately following the first for\nthe benefit of those people who were unable to view the\npremiere owing to a lack of adequate seating space.\n\nThe show lived up to its “Variety” heading as it in fact -\n\ndid present a great variety of acts ranging from folksy type\nsinging to far out humor. As a whole, the show followed\na “Laugh-In” format and starred “Dick and Jane” as mas-\nters of ceremonies and fill-in humorists. The basic format\nwas, however, overshadowed by the rest of the show as many\nof the jokes and gags 'used were either considered to be\noff-color or just not funny.\n\nThe remaining acts were the salvation of the show. All\nthe musical entertainment was superbly presented and exe-\ncuted to the utter joy and satisfaction of the entire audience\nand the audience voiced it’s approval by calling the entire\ntroupe back for several curtain-calls to the accompaniment\nof a standing ovation.\n\nRecently I conducted a poll to determine the most pop-\nular comedy acts in the show. Topping this poll by a nar-\nrow margin was “Captain Bearheart’s Little Leaguers” star-\nring Jim Hornby and the Bear Party/Education Committee\nwho did their famous rendition of “The Blimp”. Following\nclosely were “The Ballay Dancers,” “The Telephone Opera-\ntor,” “The Dirty Old Man,” and “Twink” Michaels as Bugs\nBunny in the show-opening number “This Is It”.\n\ni Obviously congratulations are in order to all those who\nmade the show the success it was. So to all those who wrote,\nperformed, and worked behind the scenes we say simply\n“Thank You”.\n\n= MISSED CONNECTION\n\nOf all the events that did come off in the 1970 Carnival,\nthe most disappointing flop was the so-called Feature En-\n\nHOW RIGHT YOU ARE\n\ntertainment. This feeling of disgust was almost universal\namong those who had purchased Carnival Passes and was\nespecially prevalent among those who paid $2.50 for tickets\nto the main entertainment only.\n\nJohn Hammond who opened the show was totally unap-\npreciated by all, myself included. Although he brought forth\nmore sounds from a guitar than most of us even imagined\nexisted, he just simply was not entertaining to 99% of the\naudience although he received polite token applause. It was\nquite obvious that the majority of the numbers were his own\ncompositions since it is highly unlikely that anyone in his\nright mind would present such crap had it been the com-\nposition of some other artist. Hammond received a tremen-\ndous ovation when his act ended as the audience were glad\nto get rid of him and not because of any great appreciation\nof his works.\n\nEster Marrow was the real star of the show and was it’s\none redeeming factor. Each number met with a tremendous\nwell-deserved round of applause. The most popular number\nEster Marrow performed was her version of “Hey Jude”\nwhich appeared to be greatly appreciated by all.\n\nThe ultimate disappointment appeared in the form of\nthe top billed “Rotary Connection” from Chicago. This group\n(and here I use the term ‘group’ in the loosest sense) turned\nout to be our one-night $2,500 white-elephant. They seemed\nto take the attitude that “We're only playing down here in\nthe sticks so we don’t have to be good anyway” and their\nperformance certainly indicated that they had taken this at-\ntitude to heart. Included among the long list of complaints\nwere the allegations that the band was too loud and that\nthey didn’t sing a decent song.\n\nWith this type of reaction and our limited entertain-\nment budget many people have suggested and even strongly\nadvocated eliminating this Feature Entertainment from the\nCarnival. This suggestion was accompanied by a further\nsuggestion that it be replaced by a second performance of\nthe variety show.\n\nCONSPIRACY CHARGES DIM CARNIVAL’S SUCCESS\n\nCharges of conspiracy to ruin the Winter Carnival were\nlevelled against the weather by representatives of the Win-\nX\n\nter Carnival Committee and the student body.\n\nDue to inclement weather the scheduled Torchlight Par-\n\n~ ade was cancelled. This must have been a supreme let-down\n\nfor those interest groups that had planned to enter a float\nin the mammoth procession. Many people felt that the par-\nade should have been rescheduled instead of being scrubbed\nentirely. A suggestion was made to the effect that the par-\nade should have taken place on the night of and immediately\npreceding the variety show. However rumor has it that an\nabbreviated version of the torchlight parade did in fact take\nplace on the night in question. Certain reliable witnesses\nreport seeing two figures trudging down the Malpeque Road\nwith a solitary torch sputtering in the rain. These reliable\nsources report that many motorists joined in the spirit of\nthe occagion by blowing their horns at these two as they\njourneyed both to and from the K-Mart.\n\nOther events made impossible by this alledged conspir-\nacy by the weather included snow-sculpturing, the Grand\nPrix, and the Midnight Skate and Bonfire.\n\nA further cancellation not due to the weather was the\n“Leg Auction” which was cancelled oddly enough due to a\nsevere shortage of legs.\n\nNotes By The Wayside\n\n...Our special sports issue seemed to be well received.\nIt received no criticism at all, which is a first for this paper.\nIt must be difficult to disagree with sports reporting or\nsomething.\n\n.. .Everybody is invited to attend the hearings being held\nby the Commission of Injuiry into the Non-Medical Use of\nDrugs and to make submissions either signed or anonymous\nas to the extent that Islanders use or are involved with var-\nious drugs. The drugs in question include narcotics as well\nas hallucinogenic and other psychotropic drugs or substan-\nces. It could be interesting. Time and Place: Confederation\nCentre Lecture Theatre, Saturday, Feb. 21.\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nResults of food poll on Malpeque Campus (Residence\nStudents).\n\n| get by with a little help from my friends\n\nby Karl M.\n\nThis week I would like to address myself to an\noft-maligned subject;—smut; In a word which is\nbecoming increasingly intolerant of almost every-\nthing, it is our duty to protect those areas which\nrender man his vicarious pleasure. Profound satis-\nfaction from direct participation is and never has\nbeen probable. Honest and healthy relationships be-\ntween individuals are not likely to exist in the mind\nof the individuals, but never simultaneously.\n\nThus is the origin of what we call male chauvin-\nism—an institution founded on the principle that if\nyou can’t trust the female of the species then you\nmust place her in a dominated protected environ-\nment which will insure her fidelity. The insidious\naspect of this kind of domination is that the female\nactually thinks that her nest (a la birds) was con-\nstructed by her mate to protect her and provide her\nwith environmental security.\n\nThis is further demonstrated in the codes for\nmoral action. It is not clear that the male has a\ndifferent code because they have established the\nroles that are to be accepted? Thus woman’s libera-\ntion under present conditions only means further\nexploitation namely sexual exploitation. If however\nthe female fails to resignize her status she will then\ncontinue to misconstrue the essential nature of the\nmale intent in the relationship. The male is obses-\nsed with achieving a conquest and a surrender from\nthe female — perhaps an attitude induced by our\nhistorical reverence of militarism. Consequently the\n\n. female is on the defensive in any heterosexual rela-\ntionship — a position she has not chosen but has\nbeen forced to take for obvious reasons.\n\nLet us briefly examine a typical relationship\nwith an eye for uncovering the weapons which are\nused against the female. First if you are endowed\nwith the requisite equipment i.e. a body and a face\nconducive to trapping the man of Your dreams then\nyou can proceed to step two. Those lacking either or\nboth of above mentioned characteristics please move\nback two spaces. We will get back to you later! Now\nhave you ever heard this one: If you really loved me\nyou would go to bed with me. Also note the pained\nplaintive look on his face. Most girls after enough\npleading will succumb. However where they make\ntheir mistake is that they also proceed to have in-\ntercourse with him. They are utterly convinced that\nhe shares the same feelings toward her. If the wom-\nan says no; then that where you less \\Well-endovwed\n\ngirls come in: you are not a higly valued commodity\non the market so your selling feature lies in the fact\nthat you are more prone to compromising yourself\nthan the others. Ask yourself why the “in” guy\n\n. when slightly shot will always direct his affections\n\ntoward the “Plain Janes...\n\nJust for laugh — ask that twit next to you at\nthe show if he would like to go to BEDDY-BY with\nyou. However before you do this make sure that\n\nyou bring a roll of toilet paper and a hanky to wipe.\n\noff the drool — both for obvious reasons! Then just\nas you are getting into bed ; agk him: “What are you\ndoing this for, you chauvinistic bastard?” If he is\ncompletely bewildered then you know that the poor\ndope is purely a product of male role theory: Also\na profuse apology indicates that he is employing a\ntactic to overcome your obvious frigidity! However\nif he understands your test then you have a guy\nwith whom you can have an honest and growing re-\n\nCUSO\n\nThis is your last chance to join the C.U.S.0. volunteers overseas\nworking side by side with the peoples in the Third World, striv- I\ning to develop and modernize the Third World countries.\n\nIt’s a job Whi’ch offers you a true life experience you’ll never\n\nforget or regret!\n\nThe door is open to You\n\nFor information and applications see:\n\nlationship. Most girls lack the guts to confront the\nmale and easily succumb to confusing needs (e.g.\nsecurity) and the feeling that you are wanted.\n\nThe jaded preamble was concocted to explode\nthe myth that there is anything valuable in concoct-\ned relationships. The ritualistic defeat of the female\nin the sexual dimension is repeated solely to revive .\nthe essence of the inherent domination. When the\nsexual act hecomes the object of the relationship:\nthen the female herself becoms less than a ‘“love ob-\nject”. She simply becomes the means to satiate the\nend. If this is not “raison d’etre” in life than you\nmust tell the exploiter to get his Hugh Hefner cata-\nlogue and order himself a plastic dummy instead of\nusing you for that sole purpose. Love is not sing-\nularly sex and a woman is not solely a Love-Mach-\nine! So read smut Hefner and Susann, because we\nain’t buying your line anymore. Let’s get on with\nthe strippers show!\n\nMR.

I\n\n FEBRUARY 20, 1970\n\nWHAT IS A STANDARD OF EDUCATION?\n\nby Carolyn Duffy\n\nWhat is an educational standard\nand who is responsible for its ef-\nfectiveness or ineffectiveness?\n\nIn a recent statement released\nto the local press, John Keaveny,\npresident of UPEISU, commented\non the low standard of education\nat UPEIL. It would be interesting\nto know what criteria he assessed\nwhich enabled him to make such an\nevaluation. Any discussion of a\nstandard is ambiguous and I feel\nthat Mr. Keaveny ought to have\nclarified and justified his state-\nment. .\n\nHow does one assess the quality\nof education one receives at a par-\nticular university ? It’s a difficult\nquestion but I would like to exam-\nine it from the student’s point of\nview. Students are given an op-\n\nor\n\n\\\n\nLET'S GET WITH IT\n\nportlinity to play a significant and\nvital role in helping determine the\nquality of education they receive.\n\nThe first couplée of years at uni-\nversity are disillusioning for most\npeople. They find themselves in\nlarge classes and feel depersonal-\nized. 'The emphasis seems to be\non lectures, examinations and as-\nsignments, and the -curriculum\ndoesn’t offer a real personal chal-\nlenge. There comes a point, how-\never, when one begins to question\nthe relevance (validity) of the\nwhole learning stuation. Am I be-\ning dictated to and vietimized by\nthe system or have I chosen to be\na bored non-participant? Once\none reaches this point of ecritical\nevaluation then he can do one of\ntwo things: he can choose to sit\naround and bitch about the sys-\ntem until he qualifies for its stamp\n\nCommission of Inquiry\ninto the NonMedical\nuse of Drugs\n\nPublic Hearings Charlottetown\n\nThe Commission is investigating every aspect of the\nnon-medical use of mood-changing drugs in Canada.\n\nDrugs under study are sedatives, stimulants, tranquil-\nizers, narcotics, hallucinogenic and other psychotropic\n\ndrugs or substances.\n\nThe Commission is holding public hearings across the\ncountry to determine the extent Canadians are involved\nwith these drugs and the effects. |\n\nThe Commission is also taking evidence in private and\nanonymously. These arrangements should be made with\nMr. James J. Moore, Executive Secretary of the Commis-\nsion, during the public hearings.\n\nSubmissions — signed or anonymous — may be sent\nto Mr. Moore, c¢/o the Commission, Vanier Building,\nNepean Street, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nThe agenda of these hearings in Charlottetown is as\n\nfollows:\n\nSaturday, February 21\n9:30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. at the Lecture Theatre, Confedera-\n\ntion Centre\n\n1 p.m. to 2 p.m. at the Junior Common Room, Montgomery\nHall, University of Prince Edward [sland\n\nIn due course the Commission will recommend to the\nFederal Government measures designed to deal with\nproblems raised by the non-medical use of drugs.\n\nThe quality and impact of these recommendations will -\ndepend mainly on the Commission’s exposure to every\npoint of view on the subject. The Commission therefore\ninvites and encourages written and/or verbal submissions\n— formally or spontaneously — from any individual or\n\ngroup.\n\nof approval (a degree) or he can\ndecide to be challenged by the\nsystem with an aim to improving\nit through participation. It’s easy\nto blame the system but how many\ntimes have we chosen not to exer-\ncise our personal freedom within\nthe educational framework? Sure-\nly you can’t deny that you do have\na personal responsibility in deter-\nmining what the learning exper-\nience will mean. You have free-\ndom to choose your curriculum,\nyour professors and are given an\nopportunity to voice your concern\nin all areas of university adminis-\ntration. If your experience in the\nacademic milieu proves to be\nmeaningless and frustrating then\nthe onus is on you and not the\nsystem. Can we accept that res-\nponsibility? Many apparently\ncan’t. It is very demanding of the\nindividual in terms of time, ener-\ngy, tolerance and patience and\neven with that, any change you\nmay have affected will seem to\nonly have scratched the surface.\nHowever, if we all were to play\nour part then the situation would\nbe radically different.\n\nWe all have our own personal\nvision of what a situation ought\nto provide for us. The decision to\nfight for personal independence\nwithin an educational system de-\nmands that we avoid the group\npoop; abandon the attitude of clin-\nical sophistication; be less tolerant\nof mediocrity and be more critical\nof our own attitudes. Decide not\nto be a bored non-participant be-\ncause it’s easy to sit around un-\nder the pretense of learning and\ntear down the system.\n\nIt is, therefore, my contention\nthat to a large degree, we, as\nstudents are responsible for help-\n\ning create a “standard” of educa-\ntion. We determine the quality of\nour educational experience and\npossibly because of our own par-\nticipation while here at university\nwe have helped create a better\nsituation for those who will follow\nus.\n\nParticipation is demanding, frus-\ntrating and downright depressing\nat times but it is also challeng-\ning, interesting, and a real learn-\ning experience. It is what you\nchoose to make it!\n\nKEAVENY CLARIFIES\n\nWhen something is referered to\nbeing low, this indicates that in\nrelation to other somethings there\nis a degree of inferiority present.\nMiss Duffy requests that I clarify\nand justify my statement. Your\nquestion is, as I see it. “Where is\nUPEI’s inferiority most pronoun-\nced y\n\nTo answer this question I would\nrefer to the AUCC report on their\nvisit to UPEI and offer as your\nanswer their remarks which indi-\ncated to me that there was some\nroom for various improvements in\nour UPEI\n\n“Some upgrading would be de-\n\nsirable in some of the humanities\n\nand social sciences departments”\n(referring to teaching staff) “The\nconsolidated university library ap-\npears adequate for the present and\nimmediate future, provided some\nselective filling is carried out.”\n\nFurther quotes from the report.\n“The committee felt that in gen-\neral, the new institution was well\nembarked on the process of merg-\n\nLook fellas...like | told ya a million times.

Like ha ha. \\\n\n- ing the academic programmes of\n\nthe two pre-existing institutions.\nIt was felt however, that a good\ndeal of sorting and sifting of of-\nferings should take place in in-\ndividual departments over the next:\nfew years. At present, there seems\nto be more courses than are neces-\nsary or desirable for the under-\ngraduate liberal arts and science\n\n_ programmes which the university\n\nis in a position to offer. On the\nother hand, there are significant\ngaps which can be filled when un-\nnecessary dispersion has been re-\nduced.”\n\n“The Visiting Committee recom-\nmended that UPEI be re-visited in\ntwo years time to assist in the\nprocess of consolidation and up-\ngrading.”\n\nIt seems to me that when I made\na statement concerning standards\nI said they were low, and in var-\nious way they -certainly are —\nplease realize that in some depart-\nments we have good faculty and\naccordingly, AUCC said, “The\nqualifications of the teaching staff\n\nThere is a tendency of the media\n(Radio, TV, commercial newspa-\npers) to include “raw statements”,\nwhich when examined in a cursory\nmanner' (as I feel Miss Duffy has\ndone) tend to mislead the listener,\n\nviewer or reader.\n\nIt is apparent to me that Miss\nDuffy is concerned with my state-\nments and indeed has been consid-\nerably mis-lead. Suffice it to say\nUPEI has the possibilities to offer\na higher standard of education, I\nsaid it was low — perhaps lower\nthan it should be, would be more\ncorrect.\n\nTrue Chequing Accounts.\n\nTrue Savings Accounts.
