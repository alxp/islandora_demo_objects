It's against the law

to pee

In the street

by Jerry Rubin
Liberation News Service

The revolution satisfies deep hum-
an needs denied by Amerikan society.
That’s why it’s so dangerous. The
biggest social problem in the country
today is loneliness.

“What are you doing tonight?”

“I don’t know, Marty, what are you
doing tonight?”

Loneliness is not an individual pro-
blem—it’s the collective problem of
millions of Amerikans, growing out
of the alienating environment we live
in. We work in one part of town with:
people who are not our friends, and
we sleep in another part of town and
don’t know our neighbors. We waste
much of our life dying in mobile con-
centration camps called freeways or
commuter trains.

Where in the city can we go to
make friends? Where can we leap
out of our individual prisons and en-
joy each other? The city is full of
walls, locked doors; signs saying

DON"T

If someone you don’t know, says
hello, you get uptight: “What’s he
want ?”’ It’s taboo to talk to strang-
ers. Everybody’s hustling. The
streets are paved with terror, the
city a prison for the soul.

The car, a box, transports lonely
people from the box where they sleep
to the box where they work, and then
back to the box where they sleep.
Amerikans relate to each other as
drivers of other cars; the only good

driver is the one who takes another
road. People killed on freeways are
casualties of a war every bit as fuck-
ed up as Vietnam.

The streets are for business, not
people. You can’t sit in a restaurant
without buying food ; you can read
magazines in a store——-you gotta buy,
huy, buv—move on, move on. What
if you’re in the mlddle of the city and
suddenly you have to take a shit?

Tough shit.

We are liberating the city, turning
the streets into our living rooms. We
live, work, eat, play and sleep togeth-
er with our friends on the streets.
Power is our ability to stand on a
street corner and do nothing., We are
creating youth ghettos in every city,
luring into the streets everyone who
is bored at home, school or work. And
everyone is looking for “something to
do.”

For us empty nockets means libera-
tion—from draft cards, checkbooks,
credit cards, registration papers—we
are close to our naked bodies.

The hippie area becomes the first
mass alternative to the Amerikan ur-
ban prison. Liberated neighborhoods
are a great threat to capitalist city
life. So the forces of death — the
business community, cops and politi-

cians — conspire to wipe us out. An

entire battery of laws — genocidal
laws against the young — makes so-
cial life in the streets a crime.

If you don’t hand a cop document-
ary proof of who you are, you can
be arrested. To the state empty poc-
kets means vagrancy.

Watching the world from a street
corner is loitering. Hitchhiking is a
crime. It’s against the law to pan-
handle, to rap to a crowd in the
streets, to give out free food in the
streets, to stop traffic. Playing a
harmonica in the streets is illegal in
Venice, California.

Two friends of mine were just ar-
rected for the high political crime
of pissing in the street. One was put
into a mental hospital.

“Underage” kids caught on the

. streets are hauled straight to juven-

ile court.

~ And when all else fails, they estab-
lish a curfew, a Nazi law designed to
prevent us from getting together.

These laws are designed to strike
fear in the youth community. Al-
though they exist on the books every-
where, they are enforced only in the
ghetto. Cops patrol the hippie areas
the way they patrol black communi-
ties, the way Amerikan soldiers pat-
rol Vietnamese villages. Everyone is
a likely enemy.

But the main strategy for destroy-
ing the free spirit is business. “Psy-
chedelic” stores try to steal the cul-
ture by selling fake arti-facts to an
emotion-starved Outside World. Cam-
eratoting Amerikan tourists come
through in buses and on foot, snap-
ping pictures, laughing, squealing,
pointing at us.

The streets turn into a hustle, a
business section.
whom to trust. Burn artists and un-
dercover cops flood the place, making
it unsafe to buy or sell dope on the
street.

image. We lack space in oﬁr own
community — to breathe; conspire,
celebrate, grow.

It is a war for land. Our survival
depends on our ability to drive out
the psychedelic exploiters, the invad-
ing pigs and the politicians, and cre-
ate youth communities where drop-
?ut from middle-clace Amerika can
ive.

Our goal is to create fires, black-
outs, subway stoppages, strikes and
snowstorms because only in crisis

does liberation come to a city. People

meet their neighbors for the first
time while watching their apartment
buildings burn down. When the sub-
way rumbles along, everyone acts as

if no one else is aboard. As soon as

there’s a breakdown, people start

talking to strangers.

The revolution declares all land

- titles null and void. We are urban

and rural liberators, seizing land for
the people. No more “I own it!” Peo-
ple who believe they can own natural
resources, industries or land are
really candidates for mental mstltu-
tions.

We will bring the war to the sub—
urbs. The middle class creates sub-

urbs as a sanctuary from the fire of

the city. Children raised in the sub-
urbs are treated as mentally and phy-
smally retarded. If we are not safe
in our communities, why should cor-
porate executives be safe in theirs?

We'll get our own tourist buses,
steal cameras and ride through the
suburbs squealing, laughing, snap-
ping and pointing fingers. :

In a revolution there are no sanc-
tuaries.

Rubin called “Do it!” It wll be released by Simon and
Schuster later this month. The book containg 43
chapters and was laid out by Quentin Fiore, and in-
cludes more than 100 pictures, cartoons and flipped-
out McLuhanesque acid layout.
