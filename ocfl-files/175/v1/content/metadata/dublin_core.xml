<dc:title>University of Prince Edward Island Cadre</dc:title>
<dc:description>The University of Prince Edward Island Cadre began publication on October 3, 1969. It was the successor to the Prince of Wales College Times and the St. Dunstan&amp;apos;s University Red and White, both of which institutions were amalgamated to form U.P.E.I. in 1969. The Cadre printed U.P.E.I. news and sports, news from other universities and strongly worded articles on current social issues. Photographs were printed in every issue. The Cadre supported student rights, sexual freedom and women&apos;s liberation. It attacked capitalism, Christianity and the Canadian university system. Issues of particular concern included unemployment, inflation and the high cost of tuition. The Cadre became less radical and critical towards the end of its publication history. It was succeeded by the UPEI Sun in the fall of 1977.</dc:description>
