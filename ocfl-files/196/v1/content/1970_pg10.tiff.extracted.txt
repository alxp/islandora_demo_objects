WHAT IS A STANDARD OF EDUCATION?

by Carolyn Duffy

What is an educational standard
and who is responsible for its ef-
fectiveness or ineffectiveness?

In a recent statement released
to the local press, John Keaveny,
president of UPEISU, commented
on the low standard of education
at UPEIL. It would be interesting
to know what criteria he assessed
which enabled him to make such an
evaluation. Any discussion of a
standard is ambiguous and I feel
that Mr. Keaveny ought to have
clarified and justified his state-
ment. .

How does one assess the quality
of education one receives at a par-
ticular university ? It’s a difficult
question but I would like to exam-
ine it from the student’s point of
view. Students are given an op-

portlinity to play a significant and
vital role in helping determine the
quality of education they receive.

The first couplée of years at uni-
versity are disillusioning for most
people. They find themselves in
large classes and feel depersonal-
ized. 'The emphasis seems to be
on lectures, examinations and as-
signments, and the -curriculum
doesn’t offer a real personal chal-
lenge. There comes a point, how-
ever, when one begins to question
the relevance (validity) of the
whole learning stuation. Am I be-
ing dictated to and vietimized by
the system or have I chosen to be
a bored non-participant? Once
one reaches this point of ecritical
evaluation then he can do one of
two things: he can choose to sit
around and bitch about the sys-
tem until he qualifies for its stamp

Commission of Inquiry
into the NonMedical
use of Drugs

Public Hearings Charlottetown

The Commission is investigating every aspect of the
non-medical use of mood-changing drugs in Canada.

Drugs under study are sedatives, stimulants, tranquil-
izers, narcotics, hallucinogenic and other psychotropic

drugs or substances.

The Commission is holding public hearings across the
country to determine the extent Canadians are involved
with these drugs and the effects. |

The Commission is also taking evidence in private and
anonymously. These arrangements should be made with
Mr. James J. Moore, Executive Secretary of the Commis-
sion, during the public hearings.

Submissions — signed or anonymous — may be sent
to Mr. Moore, c¢/o the Commission, Vanier Building,
Nepean Street, Ottawa, Canada.

The agenda of these hearings in Charlottetown is as

follows:

Saturday, February 21
9:30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. at the Lecture Theatre, Confedera-

tion Centre

1 p.m. to 2 p.m. at the Junior Common Room, Montgomery
Hall, University of Prince Edward [sland

In due course the Commission will recommend to the
Federal Government measures designed to deal with
problems raised by the non-medical use of drugs.

The quality and impact of these recommendations will -
depend mainly on the Commission’s exposure to every
point of view on the subject. The Commission therefore
invites and encourages written and/or verbal submissions
— formally or spontaneously — from any individual or

group.

of approval (a degree) or he can
decide to be challenged by the
system with an aim to improving
it through participation. It’s easy
to blame the system but how many
times have we chosen not to exer-
cise our personal freedom within
the educational framework? Sure-
ly you can’t deny that you do have
a personal responsibility in deter-
mining what the learning exper-
ience will mean. You have free-
dom to choose your curriculum,
your professors and are given an
opportunity to voice your concern
in all areas of university adminis-
tration. If your experience in the
academic milieu proves to be
meaningless and frustrating then
the onus is on you and not the
system. Can we accept that res-
ponsibility? Many apparently
can’t. It is very demanding of the
individual in terms of time, ener-
gy, tolerance and patience and
even with that, any change you
may have affected will seem to
only have scratched the surface.
However, if we all were to play
our part then the situation would
be radically different.

We all have our own personal
vision of what a situation ought
to provide for us. The decision to
fight for personal independence
within an educational system de-
mands that we avoid the group
poop; abandon the attitude of clin-
ical sophistication; be less tolerant
of mediocrity and be more critical
of our own attitudes. Decide not
to be a bored non-participant be-
cause it’s easy to sit around un-
der the pretense of learning and
tear down the system.

It is, therefore, my contention
that to a large degree, we, as
students are responsible for help-

ing create a “standard” of educa-
tion. We determine the quality of
our educational experience and
possibly because of our own par-
ticipation while here at university
we have helped create a better
situation for those who will follow
us.

Participation is demanding, frus-
trating and downright depressing
at times but it is also challeng-
ing, interesting, and a real learn-
ing experience. It is what you
choose to make it!

KEAVENY CLARIFIES

When something is referered to
being low, this indicates that in
relation to other somethings there
is a degree of inferiority present.
Miss Duffy requests that I clarify
and justify my statement. Your
question is, as I see it. “Where is
UPEI’s inferiority most pronoun-
ced y

To answer this question I would
refer to the AUCC report on their
visit to UPEI and offer as your
answer their remarks which indi-
cated to me that there was some
room for various improvements in
our UPEI

“Some upgrading would be de-

sirable in some of the humanities

and social sciences departments”
(referring to teaching staff) “The
consolidated university library ap-
pears adequate for the present and
immediate future, provided some
selective filling is carried out.”

Further quotes from the report.
“The committee felt that in gen-
eral, the new institution was well
embarked on the process of merg-

- ing the academic programmes of

It was felt however, that a good
deal of sorting and sifting of of-
ferings should take place in in-
dividual departments over the next:
few years. At present, there seems
to be more courses than are neces-
sary or desirable for the under-
graduate liberal arts and science

_ programmes which the university

is in a position to offer. On the
other hand, there are significant
gaps which can be filled when un-
necessary dispersion has been re-
duced.”

“The Visiting Committee recom-
mended that UPEI be re-visited in
two years time to assist in the
process of consolidation and up-
grading.”

It seems to me that when I made
a statement concerning standards
I said they were low, and in var-
ious way they -certainly are —
please realize that in some depart-
ments we have good faculty and
accordingly, AUCC said, “The

There is a tendency of the media
(Radio, TV, commercial newspa-
pers) to include “raw statements”,
which when examined in a cursory
manner' (as I feel Miss Duffy has
done) tend to mislead the listener,

viewer or reader.

It is apparent to me that Miss
Duffy is concerned with my state-
ments and indeed has been consid-
erably mis-lead. Suffice it to say
UPEI has the possibilities to offer
a higher standard of education, I
said it was low — perhaps lower
than it should be, would be more
correct.
