STUDENTS WILL ADVISE DEPARTMENTS

Recently there has been a
move within some of the de-
partments at UPEI to allow
students to participate in de-
partmental decision-making.

Professor Smitheram of the

Philosophy Department dis-
closed that two students with
full voting rights will be

professor.

COMPULSORY

The UPEVI senate has decreed that all students shall
take Christmas examinations, and that the mode and
recording of evaluation will be done ‘by the individual

~ The November 19 meeting also decided that grades
given by professors should be easily convertible into a

The new grading system will use the letters A, B, C,
D and F instead pnf number grades.

It was also decided that exams in non-terminal
courses should not take place after December 10, and that
~exams in terminal courses be held no later than Dec. 16.

elected December 5. They
will help decide what type of
representation students wish,
the agreed-upon number will
then aid in departmental de-
cision-making.

The Economics Department

says that they are working
through an economics club,

which is discussing the pos-
sibility of students with full
voting rights participating in
departmental meetings. No-
body participated in the first
organizational meeting that
was called, but Professor
O’Connell stated that another
meeting would be called soon.

English Department head
Dr. Coyle said “We are con-
sidering it”, when asked if
students would take part in
a_decision-making process.
He feels that a Major’s asso-
ciation might be feasible
where students could partici-
pate, but not make depart-
mental policy.

In the Physics Department,
six students were asked to
participate in decision-mak-
ing along with faculty.

Business students are al-
ready involved in decision-
making through a departmen-
tal society, said Business
professor Mr. Revell, who
further stated that there
should be little disagreement
between students and faculty,
as both had common goals.
He said that at the present
time, numbers of representa-
tives were not considered.

The controversial Educa-
tion Committee Budget was
still the topic of debate at a
record six-hour council meet-
ing at Duffy Auditorium last
Wednesday.

The cause of it all was a
petition which was presented
to council by a student group
called “The nc-longer Silent
Majority” which wished dras-
tic amendments to the Com-
mittee’s budget.

The 379 - name petition re-
commended that certain pro-
jects could be handled better
by other agencies than an
Education committee. Fear
was also expressed that the
committee’s program would
become “leftist” oriented, and
recommended that commit-
tee programs and finances be
directly under council con-
trol.

The petition also expressed
concern that the Education
Committee was attempting
to claim that they were re-
presentative of the entire
student body and that its
founders were “known Left-
ists”’, whose programs might
prove detrimental to the stu-
dent body.

The real battle began when
petition spokesman Paul Poir-
ier attempted to have the
petition passed intact by
council. The motion was de-
feated, and council proceeded
to debate the petition’s claus-
es section by section. A five-
hour marathon debate follow-
ed which lasted almost until
4 o’clock the next morning.

Accusations and insults
were exchanged by both fac-

tions as debate began, and at
one point President John
Keaveny was forced by coun-
cil to retract a statement he
made against supporters of
the petition. Supporters of
both sides refused compro-
mise conditions, which con-
tinually prevented any defin-
ite conclusion.

In the midst of the debate,
President Keaveny asked for
permission to bring up the
suggestion that he resign.
Seconded by Poirier, council
accepted the suggestion, and
Poirier read Keaveny’s re-
quest that he be relieved of
the Presidency.

In the letter, Keaveny said
that he felt he no longer
could command the -confi-
dence of the student body and
asked that the council care-
fully consider its decision
whether or not to accept his
resignation,

After a lengthy debat e,
council rejected Keaveny’s re-
quest and expressed a vote of
confidence for his policies and
actions as President. Several
observers felt Keaveny was
trying to force through his
measures by threatened re-
signation.

Debate then continued on
the Education Budget until
3 a.m. when the budget was
fing,ll.y accepted with minor
revisions.

The remaining period was
used to discuss several other
budget proposals. The Engin-
eering Society Budget was
chopped from $800 to $300,
and plans for a feasibility
study of a Radio UPEI and
a Student Union Building
were passed.

MacKAY WALKS ouT
OF SENATE

by marjorie stevenson

A second student senator
may resign from TUPEI’s
academic Senate.

Senior student Dennis Mac-
Kay walked out of Wednes-
day’s Senate meeting after
stating “If senate doesn’t be-
lieve that students have
enough experience to handle
Senate problems ... then
they shouldn’t be allowed on
Senate.”

He was referring to a Sen-
ate initial rejection of stud-
ent-faculty parity on the
Student - Faculty Academic
Planning Committee. Discus-
sion on this topic ensued af-
ter his departure. The nom-
inating committee later re-
commended that the student
advisory committee be com-
posed of two administration,
*twgs faculty, and four stud-
ents.

Mr. MacKay was unavail-
able for comment, but is be-
lieved to have re-considered
his actions and may return
to the Senate at its request.

President Baker introduc-
ed the information that the
Board of Governors has ruled
that all non-academie regula-
tions will fall under Senate
jurisdiction. The Senate de.
cided under thig ruling that
the “Student Judiciary Com-
mittee” should handle all
matters of student discipline.
If extreme legal issues are
involved, these issues will in

future be presented to the
Senate,

The Christmas gradin g
system was discussed with a
decision to leave the present
