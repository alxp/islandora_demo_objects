<dc:title>Atlantic Canada Newspaper Survey - Dataset</dc:title>
<dc:description>The Atlantic Canada Newspaper Survey (ACNS) project was designed to provide a machine-readable database of goods and services offered for sale in important east coast regional newspapers before 1900. This newspaper research database has as its focus nine broad categories of commodities based upon Statistics Canada’s “Trade of Canada Commodity Classification”. In the 1980s work on the database was supported by the Canadian Museum of Civilization. The project received SSHRC funding in 1986-1987 as part of its Research Tools Program. In June 2013, the Canadian Heritage Information Network was no longer able to host the database due to accessibility issues. CHIN exported the dataset and provided a copy to UPEI in the hopes that it would be useful.</dc:description>
