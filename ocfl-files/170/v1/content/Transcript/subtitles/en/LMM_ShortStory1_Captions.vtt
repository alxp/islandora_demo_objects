Lucy Maud Montgomery Short stories

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.634
1896 to 1901 by Lucy Maud Montgomery.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.640
A case of trespass.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.200
It was the four new novel,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.334
hazy breathless Day,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:36.374
and Dan Phillips was trouting up one of

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:36.374 --> 00:00:38.635
the back creeks of the Carlton Pond.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.432
It was somewhat cooler up the Creek

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:40.432 --> 00:00:42.542
then out on the main body of water

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.320
for the tall birches and willows.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.558
Crowding down to the brim through

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:48.423
cool green shadows across it

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.277
and shut out the scorching glare

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:50.277 --> 00:00:52.707
while a stray breeze now and then

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:54.497
rippled down the wooded slopes.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.537
Wrestling the beach leaves with an airy,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.826
pleasant sound out in the pond.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.500
The glassy water creamed and

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.170
shimmered in the hot sun.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.955
On rippled by the faintest

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:06.149
breath of air across the soft,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.014
pearly tints of the horizon,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.260
blurred the smoke of the big factories

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.948
chimneys that were owned by Mr.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.424
Walters,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:12.424 --> 00:01:15.268
to whom the pond and adjacent

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:15.268 --> 00:01:16.690
property also belonged.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.044
Mr.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.814
Walters was a comparative stranger

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:20.660
in Carlton having but recently

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.515
purchased the factories from the

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.420
heirs of the previous owner,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.653
but he had been in charge long

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.492
enough to establish a reputation

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:28.492 --> 00:01:30.124
for sternness and inflexibility

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:30.124 --> 00:01:32.400
in all his business dealings.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.760
One or two of his employees who had

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.064
been discharged by him on what they

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:38.384
deemed insufficient grounds helped

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:38.384 --> 00:01:40.426
to deepen the impression that he

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:40.426 --> 00:01:42.564
was an unjust and arbitrary man.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:44.984
Merciless to all offenders and

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:46.920
intolerant of the slightest

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:47.002 --> 00:01:49.768
infringement on his cast iron rules.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.876
Dan Phillips had been on the

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:53.280
pond ever since sunrise.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.695
The trout had risen well

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:55.827
in the early morning,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.270
but as the day wore on,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.774
growing hotter and hotter,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:01:58.774 --> 00:02:01.413
they refused to bite and for half

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:03.569
an hour Dan had not caught one.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.610
He had a goodly string of them already,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.961
however,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:08.067
and he surveyed them with satisfaction

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:10.079
as he rode his leaky little

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.158
skiff to the shore of the Creek.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.351
Pretty good catch.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:15.733
He's soliloquy's best I've had this

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:17.655
summer so far that big spotted

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:19.580
one must weigh near a pound.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.498
He's a beauty.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:20.498 --> 00:02:23.180
They're a good price over the hotels now too.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.678
I'll go home and get my dinner

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:24.678 --> 00:02:26.019
and go straight over with him.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.008
That'll leave me time for another try

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:31.400
at them about sunset, who how hot it is.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.858
I must take Ella Mae home.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.318
A bunch of them blue flags.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.418
They're real handsome.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:35.418 --> 00:02:37.980
He tide his skiff under the crowding.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.353
Alders gathered a big bunch of the

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:40.353 --> 00:02:42.967
purple flag lilies with their silky petals.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.810
And started homeward whistling cheerily.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.530
As he stepped briskly along

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.250
the Fern carpeted wood path.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.038
Then wound up the hill under

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:52.230
the beaches and furs.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.730
He was a freckled,

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.605
sunburned lad of 13 years.

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.374
His neighbors all said that Danny

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:02:57.374 --> 00:03:00.033
was as smart as a steel trap and

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:01.803
immediately added that they wondered

NOTE Confidence: 0.82579085875

00:03:01.803 --> 00:03:03.786
where he got his smartness from.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.920
Certainly not from his father.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.554
The elder Phillips had been denominated

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.995
shiftless and slack twisted by all

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:10.995 --> 00:03:13.137
who ever had any dealings with him.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.580
In his unlucky, aimless life,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.244
one of those improvident,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:17.244 --> 00:03:19.324
easygoing souls who sit contentedly

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.845
down to breakfast with a very faint

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:21.845 --> 00:03:24.218
idea where their dinner is to come from

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.444
when he had died no one had missed

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:26.444 --> 00:03:28.369
him unless it were his patients.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.378
Sad Eyed Wife,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:29.378 --> 00:03:31.394
who bravely faced her hard lot

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:33.364
and toiled unremittingly to keep

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:33.364 --> 00:03:35.710
a home for her two children,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.754
Dan and a girl two years younger

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:37.754 --> 00:03:40.088
who was a helpless cripple suffering

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:40.088 --> 00:03:42.866
from some form of spinal disease.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.480
Dan, who was old and steady for his years,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.230
had gone manfully to work

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.630
to assist his mother,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.751
though he had been disappointed in all

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:53.148
his efforts to obtain steady employment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.050
He was active and obliging,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.255
and earned many a small amount by

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:59.757
odd jobs around the village and by

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:03:59.757 --> 00:04:01.995
helping the Carlton farmers in planting

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:04.306
and harvest for the last two years.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.771
However,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:07.537
his most profitable source of summer

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:07.537 --> 00:04:10.138
income had been the trout pond.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.910
The former owner had allowed anyone

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.798
who wished to fish in his pond,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.732
and Dan made a regular business

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:15.732 --> 00:04:18.100
of it selling his trout at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.116
big hotels over at Mosquito Lake.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.794
This, in spite of its unattractive name,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.730
was a popular summer resort,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.998
and Dan always found a ready

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:26.998 --> 00:04:28.510
market for his catch.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.296
When Mr.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:29.296 --> 00:04:30.868
Walters purchased the property,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.700
it somehow never occurred to Dan

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.227
that the new owner might not be so

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:35.227 --> 00:04:36.782
complacent as his predecessor in

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:36.782 --> 00:04:38.751
the matter of the best trouting

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:38.751 --> 00:04:40.027
pond in the country.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.858
To be sure,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:40.858 --> 00:04:42.790
Dan often wondered why it was the

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:42.859 --> 00:04:44.773
pond was so deserted this summer

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:44.773 --> 00:04:47.082
he could not recall having seen a

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:47.082 --> 00:04:49.008
single person on it save himself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.277
Still,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:49.277 --> 00:04:51.413
it did not cross his mind that there

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:51.413 --> 00:04:53.590
could be any particular reason for this.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.038
He always fished up in the cool dim

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:56.038 --> 00:04:57.758
creeks which long experience had

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:04:57.758 --> 00:05:00.173
taught him were best for trout and

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:02.855
came and went by a convenient would path,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.869
but he had no thought of concealment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.366
In so doing he would not have cared,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.480
had all Carlton seen him.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.265
He had done very well with his

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:11.265 --> 00:05:13.208
fish so far and prices for trout

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:15.190
at the lake went up every day.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.444
Dan was an enterprising boy and a

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:17.444 --> 00:05:19.469
general favorite with the hotel owners.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.468
They knew that he could always

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:21.468 --> 00:05:22.467
be depended on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.150
Mrs Phillips met him at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.620
door when he reached home.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.959
See,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.315
Mother said Dan Exultantly

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:27.315 --> 00:05:29.430
as he held up his fish.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.770
Just look at that fellow,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.722
will you a pound if he's announced I

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:32.722 --> 00:05:34.729
ought to get a good price for these.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.702
I can tell you,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:35.702 --> 00:05:37.753
let me have my dinner now and I'll

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:39.881
go right over to the lake with them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.190
It's a long walk for you, Danny replied.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.690
His mother Pityingly,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.890
and it's too hot to go so far,

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.410
I'm afraid you'll get sunstruck or something.

NOTE Confidence: 0.919984864

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.777
You better wait till the cool of the evening.

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.084
You're looking real pale and thin

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:05:53.084 --> 00:05:55.422

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:05:55.422 --> 00:05:56.998
Mother assured Anne cheerfully

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:05:56.998 --> 00:05:59.248
I don't mind the heat a bit.

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.602
A fellow must put up with some

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:06:01.602 --> 00:06:02.852

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.166
And I mean to have another catch

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

I wish you'd enough to work so hard.

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.710
Mother, if I could only get a good

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.446
Sam French says that Mr Walters

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:06:16.446 --> 00:06:18.828

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.846
but I know I wouldn't do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.182
I ain't big enough.

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:23.847
Perhaps something will turn up

00:06:23.847 --> 00:06:26.067

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.550
Did you ever see such beauties?

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.938
Oh Dan, how lovely they are.

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.810
He picked up a folded

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.862
It's so seldom we see a paper

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.536
Dan went and carefully closed the

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.420
That's what it means.

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.248
Oh Danny, but you didn't no,

no,

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.578
but I ought to have remembered that he

NOTE Confidence: 0.751018462222222

00:08:39.578 --> 00:08:41.557
was the new owner and have asked him.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.770
I never thought mother what

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.296
I'm sure Danny, but if this is so,

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.309
there's only one thing to be done.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.840
You must go straight to Mr.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.157

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.610
Mother, I don't want to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.130
He's a dreadfully hard man, Sam.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:01.930
French's father says I wouldn't

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.245

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.612
Mrs Phillips firmly he's got a spite

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:08.612 --> 00:09:10.708
against him because he was dismissed.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.362
Besides Danny,

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:11.362 --> 00:09:13.644
it's the only right thing to do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.810
You know that we are poor,

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.290
but we've never done anything.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.582
Underhand yet yes, mother I know

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:19.582 --> 00:09:22.129

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.930
Down I'll go, of course,

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.830
right after dinner I was

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.350
only scared at first.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.006
I'll tell you what I'll do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:31.834
I'll clean these trout nicely and

00:09:31.834 --> 00:09:34.285
take them to Mr Walters and tell him

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:34.285 --> 00:09:36.410
that if he'll only give me time,

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.474
I'll pay him back every cent of money

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:38.474 --> 00:09:40.676
I got for all I sold this summer.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.498
Then maybe he'll let me off,

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.060
seeing as I didn't know about the notice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.700
I'll go with you, Danny.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.980
No, I'll go alone,

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.180
mother you need and go with me,

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.780
said Dan heroically to himself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.100
He said that his mother had troubles enough.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.750
He would never subject her to

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:58.584
the added ordeal of an interview

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:09:58.584 --> 00:10:00.269
with the Stern factory owner.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.678
He would bear the line in his den

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:02.678 --> 00:10:04.586

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.780
Don't tell me anything about it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.279
It would worry her and don't cry.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.896
Mother. I guess it'll be alright.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.084
Let me have my dinner now and

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:14.084 --> 00:10:15.360
I'll go straight off.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.120
Dan ate his dinner rapidly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.178
Then he carefully cleaned his trout,

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.980
put them in a long basket

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.540
with rhubarb leaves over them,

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.676
and started with an assumed cheerfulness

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:24.676 --> 00:10:27.029
very far from his real feelings.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.345
He had barely passed the

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

The newcomer nodded familiarly to Dan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

Sam French came along whistle of surprise.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

Why Dan? What's taking you there?

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

No, I'm not going for that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.899073725555555

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.548
Sam did you know that Mr Walters had

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:44.166
I can't help it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.606
If he does, said Danny stoutly,

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.188
you get outta here Sam French,

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.849
and don't be trying to scare me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.220
I mean to be honest.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.549
And how can I be if I don't own up to Mr.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.380
Walters that I've been stealing his

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.948
trout all summer, stealing fiddlesticks?

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:12:56.948 --> 00:12:59.540
Dan, I used to think you were a

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.860
chat with some sense,

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:03.418
but I see I was mistaken, you ain't.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:03.418 --> 00:13:04.390
Done no harm.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.770
Walters will never miss them.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.405
Trout, if you're so dreadful

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:07.405 --> 00:13:09.549
squeamish that you won't fish no more.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:11.878
Why you needn't but just let the matter

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:11.878 --> 00:13:14.109
drop and hold your tongue about it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.445
That's my advice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:15.445 --> 00:13:17.718
Well, it isn't my mother's then.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:17.718 --> 00:13:19.670
I mean to go by hers you need

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.730
and argue no more.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.164
Sam, I'm going.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:22.164 --> 00:13:25.392
Go then said Sam, stopping short in disgust.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:25.392 --> 00:13:28.440
You're a big fool Dan and serve you right.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.420
If Walter lands off to jail,

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.236
but I don't wish you know well if I can do

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:33.236 --> 00:13:35.000
anything for your family after you're gone,

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.300
I will and I'll try and give you a remains.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:38.268
Christian burial.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:38.268 --> 00:13:40.688
If there are any remains.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.308
So long Danny give my love to old Walters.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.818
Dan was not greatly

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:45.818 --> 00:13:47.326
encouraged by this interview.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.578
He shrank more than ever from the thought

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:51.528
of facing the stern factory owner.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.822
His courage had almost evaporated when

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:53.822 --> 00:13:56.464
he entered the office at the factory

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:56.464 --> 00:13:58.546
and asked Shakely from Mr Walters.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:01.118
He's in his office, there replied the clerk,

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.340
but he's very busy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.170
Better leave your message with me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.806
I must see Mr.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:05.806 --> 00:14:07.851
Walters himself please said Dan

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:07.851 --> 00:14:10.499
firmly but with inward trepidation.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.600
The clerk swung himself impatiently

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.891
from his stool and ushered an into Mr

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:15.891 --> 00:14:18.042
Walters private office boy to see you,

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:18.042 --> 00:14:18.300
Sir.

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.320
He said briefly,

NOTE Confidence: 0.89189639

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.700
as he closed the ground glass door

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:21.767 --> 00:14:23.996
behind him. Dan, Dizzy and Trembling

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:23.996 --> 00:14:25.866
stood in the dreaded presence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:27.406
Mr. Walters was writing at a

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:27.406 --> 00:14:28.940
table covered with the business.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.886
Like litter of papers he laid down

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:30.886 --> 00:14:33.177
his pen and looked up with a frown.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:34.644
As the clerk vanished.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:34.644 --> 00:14:38.016
He was a stern looking man with deep set

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:38.016 --> 00:14:41.030
Gray eyes and a square clean shaven chin.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:43.130
There was not an ounce of superfluous

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.539
flesh on his frame and his voice and

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:45.539 --> 00:14:48.069
manner were those of the decided resolute,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:49.658
masterful man of business.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:49.658 --> 00:14:52.040
He pointed to a capacious leather

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:52.107 --> 00:14:53.490
chair and said, concisely,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.440
what's your business with me?

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.600
Boy, Dan had carefully thought out

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.830
a statement of facts beforehand,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.478
but every word had vanished from his memory.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.030
He had only a confused,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.209
desperate consciousness that

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:07.567
he had a theft to confess.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.960
And then it must be done as soon as possible.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.762
He did not sit down. Please, Mr.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:12.762 --> 00:15:14.666
Walters. He began desperately.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.477
I came to tell you your notice.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.532
I never saw it before, and I've been fishing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:20.532 --> 00:15:22.288
On your pond, all summer,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:24.658
but I didn't know honest.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.596
I've brought you all I caught today and

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:27.596 --> 00:15:30.477
I'll pay back for them all sometime.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.652
And amused puzzled expression

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:32.652 --> 00:15:35.367
crossed Mr Walters noncommittal face.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.740
He pushed the leather chair forward.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.239
Sit down my boy he said kindly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.574
I don't quite understand this somewhat

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:44.855
mixed up statement of yours you've

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:47.495
been fishing on my pond you say didn't

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:47.566 --> 00:15:49.897
you see my notice in the advertiser?

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.340
Dan sat down more composedly.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.170
The revelation was over and

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.634
he was still alive.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.016
No,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:56.016 --> 00:15:56.392
Sir,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:58.648
we hardly ever see an advertiser

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:15:58.648 --> 00:16:00.949
and nobody told me I'd always

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:02.794
been used to fishing there,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.546
and I never thought about what

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:06.260
it was alright to keep on.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.479
I know I ought to have remembered

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:10.510
and asked you, but truly, Sir,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.030
I didn't mean to steal your fish.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.039
I used to sell them over the

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:17.139
hotels we saw the notice today.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.908
Mother and me and I came right up.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.764
I've brought you the trout I

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:21.764 --> 00:16:23.654
caught this morning and if only

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:23.654 --> 00:16:25.139
you won't prosecute me Sir,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.072
I'll pay back every cent I got

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:27.072 --> 00:16:28.699
for the others every sense,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.946
Sir, if you'll give me time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:32.310
Mr.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:34.470
Walters passed his hand across his

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.130
mouth to conceal something like a smile.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.962
Your name is Dan Phillips, isn't it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:39.962 --> 00:16:41.266
He said Irrelevantly and

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:41.266 --> 00:16:43.070
you live with your mother,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.930
the widow Phillips down there

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.046
at Carlton Corners.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.982
I understand, yes Sir,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:47.982 --> 00:16:48.948
said Dan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:50.942
Wondering how Mr Walters knew so

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:50.942 --> 00:16:53.649
much about him and if these were

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:53.649 --> 00:16:55.397
the preliminaries of prosecution.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.416
Mr Walters took up his pen and

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.150
Well, Dan,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.215
I put that notice in because I

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:17:02.215 --> 00:17:04.231
found that many people who used to

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:17:04.231 --> 00:17:06.153
fish on my pond irrespective of

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:17:08.033 --> 00:17:10.578
to lunch or camp on my property

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:17:10.578 --> 00:17:12.690
and did not a little damage.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.706
I don't care for trouting myself.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.216
I have no time for it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:16.606
However,

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:17:16.606 --> 00:17:19.308
I hardly think you'll do much damage.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915705699166666

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.050
You can keep on fishing there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.796
I'll give you a written permission

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:27.160
they won't interfere with you.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.160
As for these trout here,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.832

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:31.832 --> 00:17:34.698

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.472
How will that do?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:38.687
Thank you Sir stammered Dan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.826
He could hardly believe his ears.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.461
He took the slip of paper. Mr.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.616
Wait a minute, Dan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:46.616 --> 00:17:49.370
How was it you came to tell me this?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:51.488
You might have stopped your depredations,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.786
and I should not have been any the

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.704
Sir, said Dan, looking squarely at him.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.280
There was a brief silence.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.744
Mr Walters Thrummed

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:01.744 --> 00:18:03.696
Meditatively on the table.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.808
Dan waited Wonderingly finally the factory.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.570
Owners said abruptly there's a

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:11.060
vacant place for a boy down here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:13.540
I want it filled as soon as possible.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.284
Will you take it?

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:15.284 --> 00:18:15.720
Mr.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.342
Walters, me Dan thought the world

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:18.342 --> 00:18:20.560
must be turning upside down.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.356
Yes you you are rather young,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.992
but the duties are not hard

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:24.992 --> 00:18:26.080
or difficult to learn.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.188
I think you'll do.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:27.188 --> 00:18:29.235
I was resolved not to fill that

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:29.235 --> 00:18:31.475
place until I could find a perfectly

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:31.475 --> 00:18:33.598
honest and trustworthy boy for it.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.430
I believe I found him.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.383
I discharged the last boy because he

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:37.383 --> 00:18:39.949
lied to me about some trifling offense,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.696
for which I would have forgiven

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:41.696 --> 00:18:43.936
him if he told the truth I

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:43.936 --> 00:18:45.680
can bear with incompetency.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:47.580
But falsehood and deceit I

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.480
cannot and will not tolerate.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:52.720
He said so sternly that Dan's face paled.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.530
I am convinced that you

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:55.978
are incapable of either.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.862
Will you take the place? Dan, I will.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:57.862 --> 00:18:59.640
If you think I can fill it,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.110
Sir, I'll do my best.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:04.380
Yes, I believe you will.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:07.197
Perhaps I know more about you than you think.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.600

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.918
You have perhaps heard that I

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:17.918 --> 00:19:20.229
am an unjust and hard master.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.950
I am not the former,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.330
and you will never have occasion

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:24.650
to find me the latter.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.184
If you were always as truthful and

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:27.184 --> 00:19:28.999
straightforward as you've been today,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.440
you might easily have deceived

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.592
me in this matter,

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.030
that you did not do so is the best

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:36.507
and only recommendation I require.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.000
That will do good afternoon Dan.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.728
The whole interview had been such a

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:48.728 --> 00:19:50.818
surprise to him that he was hardly sure

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:50.818 --> 00:19:52.890
whether or not he had dreamed it all.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.329
I feel as if I were some personnel so

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:19:55.329 --> 00:19:57.946

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.180
I'll stick to her motto.

NOTE Confidence: 0.876854734666667

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.900
I wonder what Sam will say to this.
