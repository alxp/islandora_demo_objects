Recommend abolition of ‘Matrics’ in English

Hilton fires activists

Two UPEI students were fired from their jobs with
the athletic department, because of their involvement
in the action taken by the students concerning the fee
increase.

Bob Connaughton, who worked in the rink and Don
Niles, who worked as an announcer during basketball
games were told that they would lose their jobs. Ed
Hilton, Chairman of the athletic department, told them,
according to Niles that “you made asses of yourselves”
during the student action. He also told them that they

were fired. W Yy

John Keaveny, Student Union President took the
matter before the Senate. Although no formal action
was taken by the Senate, we have received information
that they were offered their jobs back the day after the
Qenate meeting. Niles refused his job back, but Con-
naughton has gone back to work, apparently because he

needs the money.

No discipline
for faculty members

At a recent meeting of the
UPEI Senate, John Keaveny
President of the Student Un-
ion, suggested that since the
University feels there is a
need for a committee to han-
dle student discipline, there
should also be one for the
faculty.

Keaveny felt that there
should be some -means for
protecting students from fac-
ulty tyranny Keaveny cited
examples of this tyranny,
such as, refusing to ans-

wer questions in class, using

attendance records in grading
He said “Students have been
even kicked out of courses for
not meeting attendance re-
quirements”. Onestudent
commented that this is sim-

ilar to a 19th century law in

Britain which held that the
penalty for attempted suicide
was death by hanging.

Keaveny felt that if this
committee on faculty was set
up as a committee of Senate
then it should be made up of
half students and half facul-

by

The suggestion apparently
got a very cool reception from
senate. President Baker sug-
gested that if this type of
committee was set up the
University would lose all of
its good faculty. .

Keavény commenting on
Bakers statement said “I feel
that if a faculty member is
doing a good job then he
would have nothing to worry

about from such a commit-

HALIFAX — At a confer-
ence at St. Mary’s University
in Halifax February 6 and 7,
a group of fifty English tea-
chers and professors from
across the Atlantic provinces
called for ‘“the abolition of
provincially standardized and
externally graded examina-
tions” in English. This would
include, delegates explained,
both the present system of
matriculation examinations,
or departmentals, and any
other uniform, provincially-
administered examination de-
signed to rate students ac-
cording to a provincewide

- standard.

Reasons given for the re-
commendation include the de-
legates’ conviction that Eng-
lish is a field where such ex-
aminations are both imperfect
as an evaluation device and
detrimental to the teaching of
English in the high schools.

It was also contended at
the meeting that such exam-

" inations cannot allow suffic-

iently for the wide diversity
of cultural backgrounds in in-
dividual provinces, but it was
decided not to make this part
of the official recommenda-
tions of the meeting.

It was also recommended
by the meeting that indivi-
dual universities should be
made responsible for selecting
their own entrance and place-
ment criteria, that the judg-
ment of the classroom teach-
er in the high school should
be “recognized as the decisive
factor” in evaluating students
in English classes, and that
universities should ‘“develop
a range of clearly differen-
tiated freshman English cour-
ses” to serve the varied needs
of incoming freshmen.

The conference, whose of-
ficial title was the “Confer-
ence on Freshman English in
the Maritimes,” included de-
legates from all four Atlantic
provinces, representing uni-
versities, high schools, and
provincial departments of

War is over (if he

WASHINGTON, DC (CPS)
—After conferring for sever-
al hours with top political,
military, economic and public
relations advisers, president
Richard Nixon today ordered
the immediate withdrawal of
all American troops from
Viet Nam.

In a startling move of ob-
scure political brilliance the
president said, “It’s not real-
ly our war, anyway.” Presi-
dential advisers cited grow-
ing political dissention at
home and a need to ‘“cement

~ our divided society and allow

us to prepare for the hard
pull ahead.”

The troops will begin leav-
ing some time next week, as
soon as the non-commission-
ed officers clubs can recoup
their losses. The pullout will
amount to some 497,000 mili-
tary and civilian personnel.

When asked if the new C5-A

transports will be used, a mil-
itary spokesman explained
that the South Vietnamese
government prohibits aircraft

whose engines produce over
140 decibels of sound.

The South Vietnamese em-
bassy was closed and the am-
bassador unavailable for com-
ment. Rumors circulating this
afternoon said the ambassa-
dor had fled the country fear-
ing threats of his life. (A
state department spokesman
denied that South. Vietnam
was preparing to sever rela-
tions with the US before the
troops could be redeployed.)

Leading economists predict
that the shift from wartime
to peacetime economy could
prove disastrous to the stab-
ility of the dollar and fear a
plunge into the depths of de-
pression. “What will we do
with the six months backlog
of war materials we have
stockviled ?”” asked Milton
Friedman, L

The president is scheduled
to go on nation-wide televis-
ion tomorrow night to make
his position perfectly -clear.
At today’s special press con-
ference he refused to go be-

education. The meeting vot-
ed overwhelmingly for the
four resolutions, and called
for another meeting to con-
tinue the discussion. “This is
really just preparing the
ground,” said one delegate.
“Now when we meet next
time we will be able to make
some concrete recommenda-
tions about freshman English
courses.”

One effect of -the resolu-
tions, delegates pointed out,
would be to promote a closer
liaison between high schools
and universities, ‘“because you
wouldn’t have the matrics
making a wall between them.”
It was also asserted that
these resolutions should ap-
ply to disciplines other than
English. According to a New
Brunswick delegate, “The
evils perpetrated by matrics
pervade our entire education-
al gystem.”

A second meeting is tenta-
tively scheduled for the fall,
in Fredericton.

wants it)

yond the following general
statement:

“I want my position to be
perfectly clear. This nation
is going to fight communism
wherever it springs up. Now,
my fellow Americans, I rea-
lize the tremendous strain on
our economy the end of the
war in Viet Nam could be,
and I have provided for it.

“Our neighbor to the north
has long been frought with
internal strife. From the pro-
tection Canada has been giv-
ing our young draft dodgers
it becomes apparent that Can-
ada has been taken over by
the communists. We cannot
allow this threat so close to
our own 8oil.

“After much deliberation,
I havg ordered the saturation
bombing of eastern Canada,
and our troops are already
securing the principal ports,
airports, and border cross-
ings. If we pull together in
this fight, Canada will soon
be a safe place to live for all
peace-loving people.”
